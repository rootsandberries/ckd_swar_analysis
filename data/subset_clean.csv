5987,5987,"Vettoretti, S. and Pontremoli, R. and Messa, P.",Treatment of hyperuricemia in CKD,2015,Giornale italiano di nefrologia : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di nefrologia,"Numerous epidemiological studies conducted in the general population indicate that hyperuricemia is associated with an increased risk of developing renal failure. Moreover, among those subjects who are already suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD), hyperuricemia is associated with a more rapid progression of disease besides with an increased risk of mortality and cardiovascular events. However, to date, the causal role of hyperuricaemia in determining the onset and progression of cardiovascular and renal damage is not yet fully established. Therefore the indications for pharmacological treatment of hyperuricemia (and particulary of asymptomatic hyperuricemia) in patients with CKD are still assigned to the personal orientation of the physician. In order to produce an evidence-based clinical appraisal on this topic, we performed a comparative analysis that included all the prospective studies that have evaluated the impact of treatment with xanthine oxidase inhibithors (XOI) with respect to the onset and progression of CKD. Moreover, since in the past the treatment with XOI was associated with a high risk of toxicity in patients with impaired renal function, we analyzed the toxicity of these drugs for various degrees of renal function impairment summarizing indications, contraindications and recommended doses in patients affected by CKD. In the end, as conclusion of our analysis, we propose an algorithm aimed at guiding the clinical decisions about the treatment of hyperuricemia in patients with CKD.",,32,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016649924&partnerID=40&md5=0f701dc09baa4184df2fcc6a961578a6,,,,ScopusTIAB,search,ScopusTIAB,,,,,search,20

Sun,The Neural Network of One-Dimensional Convolution-An Example of the Diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy,2019,IEEE Access,"Diabetes is a serious threat to health development, because diabetes is a disease that caused most other diseases (complications). Diabetic retinopathy is the most important manifestation of diabetic microangiopathy and is also one of the most common complications in people with diabetes. At present, the diagnosis of diabetic retinal complications mainly depends on the pictures for diagnosis. The fundus images are the main ways to diagnose retinal diseases at present, but the diagnosis process is complicated. Based on this, this paper uses the electronic medical record information of 301 hospitalized patients with diabetes from 2009 to 2013, mainly using the diabetes diagnostic data, diabetes glycosylation data and diabetes biochemical test data, the depth of learning methods and medical diabetes combined with the application of convolution Neural Network Method (CNN) to build a diagnostic model, and thus draw the diagnosis. The main contribution of this study is twofold: 1) In this paper, we apply the CNN method to one-dimensional unrelated data sets and solve the problem of how to do one-dimensional irrelevant data convolution. 2) In this paper, the CNN model is combined with the BN layer to prevent the dispersion of the gradient, speed up the training speed and improve the accuracy of the model. In addition, this model incorporates an adaptive learning rate algorithm and optimizes the model. The experiments show that this method can achieve a training accuracy of 99.85% and a testing accuracy of 97.56%, which is more than 2% higher than that of using logistic regression.

The current guidelines besides the individual approach greatly emphasize on the importance of population level approaches to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Systematic global cardiovascular disease risk assessment is recommended in individuals with any major vascular risk factor. Regarding LDL-cholesterol, blood pressure, and glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus, goals and targets remain as recommended in previous guidelines. However, it is proposed a new, stepwise approach (steps 1 and 2) to treatment intensification as a tool to help physicians and patients pursue these targets in a way that fits patient profile. After step 1, considering proceeding to the intensified goals of step 2 is mandatory, and this intensification will be based on 10-year cardiovascular disease risk, lifetime cardiovascular disease risk and treatment benefit, comorbidities and patient preferences. The updated SCORE algorithm ?SCORE2, SCORE2-OP? is recommended in these guidelines, which estimates an individual's 10-year risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease events (myocardial infarction, stroke) in healthy men and women aged 40-89 years. Another new and important recommendation is the use of different categories of risk according to different age groups (< 50, 50-69, ≥ 70 years). Different flow charts of cardiovascular disease risk and risk factor treatment in apparently healthy persons, in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and in diabetic patients are recommended. Patients with chronic kidney disease are considered high risk or very high-risk patients according to the levels of glomerular filtration rate and albumin-to-creatinine ratio. New lifestyle recommendations adapted to the ones published by the Spanish Ministry of Health as well as recommendations focused on the management of lipids, blood pressure, diabetes and chronic renal failure are included. © 2022 Sociedad Española de Arteriosclerosis",10.1016/j.arteri.2022.03.003,34,4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134932963&doi=10.1016%2fj.arteri.2022.03.003&partnerID=40&md5=d466ccbdce739ed5b9da658e0c95fa6f,1578-1879 0214-9168,219,,"ScopusTIAB, Medline","search, search","ScopusTIAB, Medline",4,219,1578-1879 0214-9168,,"search, search",NA

Methods Totally 28 ESRD patients (ESRD group) and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (control group) underwent rs-fMRI and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The laboratory tests, including serum creatinine and urea, were performed in all ESRD patients. SPM 8 and REST 1.4 software were used to process the data and generate all participants' mean ALFF maps. Two-sample t test was used to determine the mean ALFF differences between ESRD group and control group. In addition, the Pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between the brain regions with different mean ALFF value and the MoCA scores, serum creatinine and urea level. Results Compared with control group, MoCA scores in ESRD groups were significantly lower (P=0.006). The brain regions with significantly decreased mean ALFF value in ESRD group including bilateral middle frontal gyrus, bilateral medial frontal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus, bilateral precuneus, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral caudate, bilateral cingulate gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus and bilateral temporal gyrus (all P<0.001, FDR correction). No brain region with increased mean ALFF value was found. The mean ALFF value in left middle frontal gyrus (r=0.68, P<0.001, FDR correction) and left middle temporal gyrus (r=0.59, P<0.001, FDR correction) was positively correlated with MoCA scores of ESRD patients. No significant correlation was found between ALFF value of brain regions and serum creatinine nor urea level (all P>0.05). Conclusion Cognitive dysfunction in ESRD patients is closely correlated with the changes of spontaneous brain activity in left middle frontal gyrus and left middle temporal gyrus, which might provide imaging marker of brain function for hemodialysis ESRD patients.

Their increasing availability has fueled new hopes to leverage them and develop accurate risk prediction models for a wide range of diseases. Given the complex interrelationships of medical records and patient outcomes, deep learning models have shown clear merits in achieving this goal. However, a key limitation of current study remains their capacity in processing long sequences, and long sequence modelling and its application in the context of healthcare and EHR remains unexplored. Capturing the whole history of medical encounters is expected to lead to more accurate predictions, but the inclusion of records collected for decades and from multiple resources can inevitably exceed the receptive field of the most existing deep learning architectures. This can result in missing crucial, long-term dependencies. To address this gap, we present Hi-BEHRT, a hierarchical Transformer-based model that can significantly expand the receptive field of Transformers and extract associations from much longer sequences. Using a multimodal large-scale linked longitudinal EHR, the Hi-BEHRT exceeds the state-of-the-art deep learning models 1% to 5% for area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve and 1% to 8% for area under the precision recall (AUPRC) curve on average, and 2% to 8% (AUROC) and 2% to 11% (AUPRC) for patients with long medical history for 5-year heart failure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and stroke risk prediction. Additionally, because pretraining for hierarchical Transformer is not well-established, we provide an effective end-to-end contrastive pre-training strategy for Hi-BEHRT using EHR, improving its transferability on predicting clinical events with relatively small training dataset.",10.1109/JBHI.2022.3224727,PP,2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144064624&doi=10.1109%2fJBHI.2022.3224727&partnerID=40&md5=1a2bb79036dd6e2226c355a97969a343,2168-2208 2168-2194,1106,,"Medline, ScopusTIAB, IEEE","search, search, search","Medline, ScopusTIAB, IEEE",2,1106,2168-2208 2168-2194,,"search, search, search",NA

It ensures the survival of almost 2 million patients worldwide. Considerable progress has been made in recent years thanks to a better understanding of uremia, optimization of treatment modalities and more personalized treatment schedules. Increase of uremic toxins removal, improvement of hemodynamic tolerance of the sessions, reduction of proinflammatory reactions due to the bioincompatibility system are major advances that may explain the reduction of morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients. New technologies (nanotechnology, biotechnology, microelectronics) are now expected to introduce further progresses by miniaturizing devices and providing them with an ""artificial Intelligence"" capable of interacting with the patient. The main obstacle remains ageing of uremic patients, increasing prevalence of comorbidities and shortage of social resources that are not conducive to innovation. By promoting a more physiological, longer and more effective hemodialysis performed at home with help of teledialysls monitoring that would probably be an interesting option to evaluate on a medico-economical point of view.",,62,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84856565015&partnerID=40&md5=093bc0922bef139daf5a0548cc0b2a54,,53,,ScopusTIAB,search,ScopusTIAB,1,53,,,search,NA

Access and Quality Index based on mortality from causes amenable to personal health care in 195 countries and territories, 1990-2015: a novel analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015",2017,"Lancet (London, England)","BACKGROUND: National levels of personal health-care access and quality can be approximated by measuring mortality rates from causes that should not be fatal in the presence of effective medical care (ie, amenable mortality). Previous analyses of mortality amenable to health care only focused on high-income countries and faced several methodological challenges. In the present analysis, we use the highly standardised cause of death and risk factor estimates generated through the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) to improve and expand the quantification of personal health-care access and quality for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. METHODS: We mapped the most widely used list of causes amenable to personal health care developed by Nolte and McKee to 32 GBD causes. We accounted for variations in cause of death certification and misclassifications through the extensive data standardisation processes and redistribution algorithms developed for GBD. To isolate the effects of personal health-care access and quality, we risk-standardised cause-specific mortality rates for each geography-year by removing the joint effects of local environmental and behavioural risks, and adding back the global levels of risk exposure as estimated for GBD 2015. We employed principal component analysis to create a single, interpretable summary measure-the Healthcare Quality and Access (HAQ) Index-on a scale of 0 to 100. The HAQ Index showed strong convergence validity as compared with other health-system indicators, including health expenditure per capita (r=0·88), an index of 11 universal health coverage interventions (r=0·83), and human resources for health per 1000 (r=0·77). We used free disposal hull analysis with bootstrapping to produce a frontier based on the relationship between the HAQ Index and the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a measure of overall development consisting of income per capita, average years of education, and total fertility rates. This frontier allowed us to better quantify the maximum levels of personal health-care access and quality achieved across the development spectrum, and pinpoint geographies where gaps between observed and potential levels have narrowed or widened over time. FINDINGS: Between 1990 and 2015, nearly all countries and territories saw their HAQ Index values improve; nonetheless, the difference between the highest and lowest observed HAQ Index was larger in 2015 than in 1990, ranging from 28·6 to 94·6. Of 195 geographies, 167 had statistically significant increases in HAQ Index levels since 1990, with South Korea, Turkey, Peru, China, and the Maldives recording among the largest gains by 2015. Performance on the HAQ Index and individual causes showed distinct patterns by region and level of development, yet substantial heterogeneities emerged for several causes, including cancers in highest-SDI countries; chronic kidney disease, diabetes, diarrhoeal diseases, and lower respiratory infections among middle-SDI countries; and measles and tetanus among lowest-SDI countries. While the global HAQ Index average rose from 40·7 (95% uncertainty interval, 39·0-42·8) in 1990 to 53·7 (52·2-55·4) in 2015, far less progress occurred in narrowing the gap between observed HAQ Index values and maximum levels achieved; at the global level, the difference between the observed and frontier HAQ Index only decreased from 21·2 in 1990 to 20·1 in 2015. If every country and territory had achieved the highest observed HAQ Index by their corresponding level of SDI, the global average would have been 73·8 in 2015. Several countries, particularly in eastern and western sub-Saharan Africa, reached HAQ Index values similar to or beyond their development levels, whereas others, namely in southern sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and south Asia, lagged behind what geographies of similar development attained between 1990 and 2015. INTERPRETATION: This novel extension of the GBD Study shows the untapped potential for personal health-care access and quality improvement across the development spectrum. Amid substantive advances in personal health care at the national level, heterogeneous patterns for individual causes in given countries or territories suggest that few places have consistently achieved optimal health-care access and quality across health-system functions and therapeutic areas. This is especially evident in middle-SDI countries, many of which have recently undergone or are currently experiencing epidemiological transitions. The HAQ Index, if paired with other measures of health-system characteristics such as intervention coverage, could provide a robust avenue for tracking progress on universal health coverage and identifying local priorities for strengthening personal health-care quality and access throughout the world.

However, most work to date has investigated the binary classification problem for predicting the onset of one chronic disease, but little attention has been given to assessing risk of developing comorbidities that are major causes of morbidity and mortality. For example, type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease frequently accompany congestive heart failure. This paper is motivated by the problem of predicting comorbid diseases and aims to answer the following question: Can we predict the comorbid risk using a patient's medical history? We propose a new predictive learning framework, Heterogeneous Convolutional Neural Network (HCNN), that represents EHRs as graphs with heterogeneous attributes (e.g. diagnoses, procedures, and medication), and then develop a novel deep learning methodology for risk prediction of multiple comorbid diseases. The main innovation of the framework is that it defines the distance between the heterogeneous attributes of the graph representation extracted from the EHR and develops an appropriate learning infrastructure that is a composition of sparse convolutional layers and local pooling steps that match with the local structure of the space of the heterogeneous attributes. As a result, the new method is capable of capturing features about the relationships between heterogeneous attributes of the graphs. Through a comparative study on patient EHR data, HCNN achieves better performance than traditional convolutional neural networks on the risk prediction of comorbid diseases. © 2017 IEEE.",10.1109/CHASE.2017.80,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029348271&doi=10.1109%2fCHASE.2017.80&partnerID=40&md5=abc9d978fdc1f3c55cc5e5f2393c8bd2,978-1-5090-4721-5,214,,"ScopusTIAB, ACM, IEEE","search, search, search","ScopusTIAB, ACM, IEEE",,214,978-1-5090-4721-5,,"search, search, search",NA

Men with ED generally complain failure to attain or maintain an adequate erection during sexual activity. The prevalence of ED is strongly correlated with age, affecting about 40% of men at age 40 and nearly 70% at age 70. A variety of chronic diseases, including diabetes, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, depression, chronic renal failure, obstructive sleep apnea, prostate disease, gout, and sleep disorder, were reported to be associated with ED. In this study, data retrieved from a subset of the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan were used for designing the clinical decision support system (CDSS) for predicting ED incidences in men. The positive cases were male patients aged 20-65 who were diagnosed with ED between January 2000 and December 2010 confirmed by at least three outpatient visits or at least one inpatient visit, while the negative cases were randomly selected from the database without a history of ED and were frequency (1:1), age, and index year matched with the ED patients. Data of a total of 2832 ED patients and 2832 non-ED patients, each consisting of 41 features including index age, 10 comorbidities, and 30 other comorbidity-related variables, were retrieved for designing the predictive models. Integrated genetic algorithm and support vector machine was adopted to design the CDSSs with two experiments of independent training and testing (ITT) conducted to verify their effectiveness. In the 1st ITT experiment, data extracted from January 2000 till December 2005 (61.51%, 1742 positive cases and 1742 negative cases) were used for training and validating and the data retrieved from January 2006 till December 2010 were used for testing (38.49%), whereas in the 2nd ITT experiment, data in the training set (77.78%) were extracted from January 2000 till Deceber 2007 and those in the testing set (22.22%) were retrieved afterward. Tenfold cross validation and three different objective functions were adopted for obtaining the optimal models with best predictive performance in the training phase. The testing results show that the CDSSs achieved a predictive performance with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, g-mean, and area under ROC curve of 74.72%-76.65%, 72.33%-83.76%, 69.54%-77.10%, 0.7468-0.7632, and 0.766-0.817, respectively.

The key to its success is about transferring knowledge from a large teacher network to a small student network. However, most existing KD methods consider only one type of knowledge learned from either instance features or relations via a specific distillation strategy, failing to explore the idea of transferring different types of knowledge with different distillation strategies. Moreover, the widely used offline distillation also suffers from a limited learning capacity due to the fixed large-to-small teacher&#x2013;student architecture. In this article, we devise a collaborative KD via multiknowledge transfer (CKD-MKT) that prompts both self-learning and collaborative learning in a unified framework. Specifically, CKD-MKT utilizes a multiple knowledge transfer framework that assembles self and online distillation strategies to effectively: 1) fuse different kinds of knowledge, which allows multiple students to learn knowledge from both individual instances and instance relations, and 2) guide each other by learning from themselves using collaborative and self-learning. Experiments and ablation studies on six image datasets demonstrate that the proposed CKD-MKT significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods for KD.

A multidisciplinary working group was convened with the goal of developing and promoting recommendations that achieve consensus on these issues. The working group recommended that the preferred method for assessment of albuminuria in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients is urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) measurement in a first-void spot urine specimen. Where a first-void specimen is not possible or practical, a random spot urine specimen for UACR is acceptable. The working group recommended that adults with one or more risk factors for CKD should be assessed using UACR and estimated GFR every 1-2 years, depending on their risk-factor profile.

It's impact in the quality of life makes it one of the major problems in CKD patients. Although the etiology is multifactorial the suboptimal production of erithropoietin caused by renal mass loss appears to be of major importance. After the introduction of Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA's) the treatment of anemia in CKD has changed dramatically. Today, ESA's have a fundamental role in the increase of Hb values in CKD. Previously, severe anemia was frequent and blood transfusions were often necessary to improve patients quality of life. Small observational studies performed during the late 80's suggested that high Hb values may be benefic in CKD patients. At that time, the use of ESA's became universal. Later randomized trials tried to show the positive impact of rising Hb levels with ESA's in patient's outcome. The results of such studies were disappointing. Some of them even documented higher mortality associated with near normal Hb levels, failing to prove the real benefit of the complete correction of CKD anemia. We're still waiting for new randomized trials to be elucidated about the optimal target of Hb to achieve in CKD and the treatment algorithm with ESA's. Current evidence sugests that Hb values must be targetted at 11-12g/dL, without reaching the complete correction of anaemia.",,24,SUPPL.4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84864271505&partnerID=40&md5=d8aa47f9ce9ff8037be4ead8aec122d5,,869,,ScopusTIAB,search,ScopusTIAB,SUPPL.4,869,,,search,22

The purpose is to determine whether dipstick data effectively identify patients with increased UPC ratios. Because urine concentration affects proteinuria interpretation, we hypothesized that dipstick protein (DSP) and specific gravity (SG) are sufficient for screening. METHODS: A hospital laboratory database was searched for urine samples simultaneously assayed for UPC ratio, DSP, and SG (n = 2,098). A random 70% of the cohort was used to generate a development model, which was validated in the remaining 30%. Samples were stratified according to DSP and SG values. A DSP versus SG matrix was created, and each sample was allocated to a discrete DSP-SG category. Proportions of samples with overt (UPC ratio > or = 500 mg/g) and nephrotic-range proteinuria (UPC ratio > or = 3,000 mg/g) were calculated for all 40 cells. RESULTS: Optimum correlations between DSP-SG cells and UPC ratios were determined for the development model, yielding 97.0% negative predictive value (NPV) for a UPC ratio of 500 mg/g or less and 97.5% positive predictive value (PPV) for a UPC ratio of 500 mg/g or greater. NPV for a UPC ratio of 3,000 mg/g or less was 99.7%. Application of the model to the validation sample showed a 96.5% NPV for a UPC ratio of 500 mg/g or less, 99.4% PPV for a UPC ratio of 500 mg/g or greater, and 99.0% NPV for a UPC ratio of 3,000 mg/g or less. CONCLUSION: DSP and SG values effectively identify patients requiring proteinuria quantification by means of UPC ratio.

Moreover, among those subjects who are already suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD), hyperuricemia is associated with a more rapid progression of disease besides with an increased risk of mortality and cardiovascular events. However, to date, the causal role of hyperuricaemia in determining the onset and progression of cardiovascular and renal damage is not yet fully established. Therefore the indications for pharmacological treatment of hyperuricemia (and particulary of asymptomatic hyperuricemia) in patients with CKD are still assigned to the personal orientation of the physician. In order to produce an evidence-based clinical appraisal on this topic, we performed a comparative analysis that included all the prospective studies that have evaluated the impact of treatment with xanthine oxidase inhibithors (XOI) with respect to the onset and progression of CKD. Moreover, since in the past the treatment with XOI was associated with a high risk of toxicity in patients with impaired renal function, we analyzed the toxicity of these drugs for various degrees of renal function impairment summarizing indications, contraindications and recommended doses in patients affected by CKD. In the end, as conclusion of our analysis, we propose an algorithm aimed at guiding the clinical decisions about the treatment of hyperuricemia in patients with CKD.",,32 Suppl 62,,,1724-5990 0393-5590,gin/32.S62.9,,Medline,search,Medline,,gin/32.S62.9,1724-5990 0393-5590,,search,20

We present the Spanish adaptation of the 2021 European Guidelines on Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) prevention in clinical practice. The current guidelines besides the individual approach greatly emphasize on the importance of population level approaches to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Systematic global CVD risk assessment is recommended in individuals with any major vascular risk factor. Regarding LDL-Cholesterol, blood pressure, and glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus, goals and targets remain as recommended in previous guidelines. However, it is proposed a new, stepwise approach (Step 1 and 2) to treatment intensification as a tool to help physicians and patients pursue these targets in a way that fits patient profile. After Step 1, considering proceeding to the intensified goals of Step 2 is mandatory, and this intensification will be based on 10-year CVD risk, lifetime CVD risk and treatment benefit, comorbidities and patient preferences. The updated SCORE algorithm-SCORE2, SCORE-OP- is recommended in these guidelines, which estimates an individual's 10-year risk of fatal and non-fatal CVD events (myocardial infarction, stroke) in healthy men and women aged 40-89 years. Another new and important recommendation is the use of different categories of risk according different age groups (< 50, 50-69 ≥ 70 years). Different flow charts of CVD risk and risk factor treatment in apparently healthy persons, in patients with established atherosclerotic CVD, and in diabetic patients are recommended.

It ensures the survival of almost 2 million patients wordwide. Considerable progress has been made in recent years thanks to a better understanding of uremia, optimization of treatment modalities and more personalized treatment schedules. Increase of uremic toxins removal, improvement of hemodynamic tolerance of the sessions, reduction of proinflammatory reactions due to the bioincompatibility system are major advances that may explain the reduction of morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients. New technologies (nanotechnology, biotechnology, microelectronics) are now expected to introduce further progresses by miniaturizing devices and providing them with an ""artificial intelligence"" capable of interacting with the patient. The main obstacle remains ageing of uremic patients, increasing prevalence of comorbidities and shortage of social resources that are not conducive to innovation. By promoting a more physiological, longer and more effective hemodialysis performed at home with help of teledialysis monitoring that would probably be an interesting option to evaluate on a medico-economical point of view.",,62,1,,0035-2640,53,,Medline,search,Medline,1,53,0035-2640,,search,NA

It's impact in the quality of life makes it one of the major problems in CKD patients. Although the etiology is multifactorial the suboptimal production of erithropoietin caused by renal mass loss appears to be of major importance. After the introduction of Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA's) the treatment of anemia in CKD has changed dramatically. Today, ESA's have a fundamental role in the increase of Hb values in CKD. Previously, severe anemia was frequent and blood transfusions were often necessary to improve patients quality of life. Small observational studies performed during the late 80's suggested that high Hb values may be benefic in CKD patients. At that time, the use of ESA's became universal. Later randomized trials tried to show the positive impact of rising Hb levels with ESA's in patient's outcome. The results of such studies were disappointing. Some of them even documented higher mortality associated with near normal Hb levels, failing to prove the real benefit of the complete correction of CKD anemia. We're still waiting for new randomized trials to be elucidated about the optimal target of Hb to achieve in CKD and the treatment algorithm with ESA's. Current evidence suggests that Hb values must be targetted at 11-12 g/dL, without reaching the complete correction of anaemia.",,24 Suppl 4,,,1646-0758 0870-399X,869,,Medline,search,Medline,,869,1646-0758 0870-399X,,search,22

[68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET parameters have been shown to correlate with estimated GFR (eGFR). The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between renal [18F]PSMA-1007 uptake and eGFR. Methods: Hundred and eighty-five patients underwent PET imaging at 1 and 2 h after injection of 4.0 ± 0.2 MBq [18F]PSMA-1007. Serum creatinine levels were measured and GFR estimated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equations. Fifteen patients were excluded due to missing or incorrect data. Thus, data from 170 patients were analyzed. Kidneys were segmented in the PET images using a convolutional neural network with manual correction. For each kidney, mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) and segmentation volume in millilitres were measured. Linear regression analyses were performed with eGFR as the outcome variable. Results: Variation in the eGFR values was explained to a significant degree by SUVmean and renal segmentation volume in both the 1 and 2 h images. This correlation was stronger for CKD-EPI eGFR (1 h R2 = 0.64; 2 h R2 = 0.64) than for MDRD eGFR (1 h R2 = 0.47; 2 h R2 = 0.45).
