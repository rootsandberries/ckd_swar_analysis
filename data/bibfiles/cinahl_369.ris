AB  - Objective. To establish a prediction model for the risk evaluation of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to guide the management and prevention of CKD. Methods. A total of 1263 patients with CKD and 1948 patients without CKD admitted to the Tongde Hospital of the Zhejiang Province from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2018, were retrospectively analyzed. Spearman's correlation was used to analyze the relationship between CKD and laboratory parameters. XGBoost, random forest, Naive Bayes, support vector machine, and multivariate logistic regression algorithms were employed to establish prediction models for the risk evaluation of CKD. The accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of each model were compared. The new bidirectional encoder representations from transformers with light gradient boosting machine (MD-BERT-LGBM) model was used to process the unstructured data and transform it into researchable unstructured vectors, and the AUC was compared before and after processing. Results. Differences in laboratory parameters between CKD and non-CKD patients were observed. The neutrophil ratio and white blood cell count were significantly associated with the occurrence of CKD. The XGBoost model demonstrated the best prediction effect (accuracy = 0.9088, precision = 0.9175, recall = 0.8244, F1 score = 0.8868, AUC = 0.8244), followed by the random forest model (accuracy = 0.9020, precision = 0.9318, recall = 0.7905, F1 score = 0.581, AUC = 0.9519). Comparatively, the predictions of the Naive Bayes and support vector machine models were inferior to those of the logistic regression model. The AUC of all models was improved to some extent after processing using the new MD-BERT-LGBM model. Conclusion. The new MD-BERT-LGBM model with the inclusion of unstructured data has contributed to the higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the prediction models. Clinical features such as age, gender, urinary white blood cells, urinary red blood cells, thrombin time, serum creatinine, and total cholesterol were associated with CKD incidence.

AB  - Background. Renal osteodystrophy (ROD) secondary to chronic kidney disease is closely associated with osteoporosis and fractures. Based on the theory of "kidney governing bones" in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), treating bone diseases from the perspective of the kidney has become a basic principle of treating ROD. However, there are many kidney-tonifying herbs and their mechanisms of treating ROD are not clear. Therefore, our study intends to use data mining and network pharmacology to study the commonly used kidney-tonifying herbs, as well as their active ingredients and mechanisms of treating ROD. Methods. We established a clinical ROD database by searching PubMed, CNKI, and other databases and screened out a core herbal combination of treating ROD. Furthermore, by using databases such as Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform and GeneCards, we obtained active ingredients and targets of the core herbal combination and ROD targets. The STRING website and Cytoscape software were then used to obtain information on key active ingredients and key targets. Finally, we conducted GO and KEGG analyses using the Metascape website and molecular docking using the AutoDock Vina software. Results. Our study eventually included 58 prescriptions and 116 herbs of treating ROD. Through data mining, we found that yin-yang-huo, du-zhong, and bu-gu-zhi (YDB) constituted a core herbal combination to treat ROD. Network pharmacology showed that YDB mainly acted on targets such as estrogen receptor alpha through active ingredients such as quercetin by mitogen-activated protein kinase and other signaling pathways. Conclusion. Many ingredients, targets, and pathways are involved in the treatment of YDB for ROD. Specifically, the flavonoids contained in YDB have great potential for ROD treatment.

AB  - Background: Wild-type transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is a frequently under-recognized cause of heart failure (HF) in older patients. To improve identification of patients at risk for the disease, we initiated a pilot program in which 9 cardiac/non-cardiac phenotypes and 20 high-performing phenotype combinations predictive of wild-type ATTR-CM were operationalized in electronic health record (EHR) configurations at a large academic medical center. Methods: Inclusion criteria were age >50 years and HF; exclusion criteria were end-stage renal disease and prior amyloidosis diagnoses. The different Epic EHR configurations investigated were a clinical decision support tool (Best Practice Advisory) and operational/analytical reports (Clarity™, Reporting Workbench™, and SlicerDicer); the different data sources employed were problem list, visit diagnosis, medical history, and billing transactions. Results: With Clarity, among 45 051 patients with HF, 4006 patients (8.9%) had ⩾1 phenotype combination associated with increased risk of wild-type ATTR-CM. Across all data sources, 2 phenotypes (cardiomegaly; osteoarthrosis) and 2 combinations (carpal tunnel syndrome + HF; atrial fibrillation + heart block + cardiomegaly + osteoarthrosis) generated the highest proportions of patients for wild-type ATTR-CM screening. Conclusion: All EHR configurations tested were capable of operationalizing phenotypes or phenotype combinations to identify at-risk patients; the Clarity report was the most comprehensive.

AB  - Background: Early kidney and anatomic features may be predictive of future progression and need for additional procedures in patients with posterior urethral valve (PUV). The objective of this study was to use machine learning (ML) to predict clinically relevant outcomes in these patients. Methods: Patients diagnosed with PUV with kidney function measurements at our institution between 2000 and 2020 were included. Pertinent clinical measures were abstracted, including estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at each visit, initial vesicoureteral reflux grade, and renal dysplasia at presentation. ML models were developed to predict clinically relevant outcomes: progression in CKD stage, initiation of kidney replacement therapy (KRT), and need for clean-intermittent catheterization (CIC). Model performance was assessed by concordance index (c-index) and the model was externally validated. Results: A total of 103 patients were included with a median follow-up of 5.7 years. Of these patients, 26 (25%) had CKD progression, 18 (17%) required KRT, and 32 (31%) were prescribed CIC. Additionally, 22 patients were included for external validation. The ML model predicted CKD progression (c-index = 0.77; external C-index = 0.78), KRT (c-index = 0.95; external C-index = 0.89) and indicated CIC (c-index = 0.70; external C-index = 0.64), and all performed better than Cox proportional-hazards regression. The models have been packaged into a simple easy-to-use tool, available at https://share.streamlit.io/jcckwong/puvop/main/app.py Conclusion: ML-based approaches for predicting clinically relevant outcomes in PUV are feasible. Further validation is warranted, but this implementable model can act as a decision-making aid. A higher resolution version of the Graphical abstract is available as Supplementary information

AB  - Purpose: This study sought to determine whether machine learning (ML) can be used to better identify the risk factors and establish the prediction models for the prevalence and severity of coronary artery calcification (CAC) in nondialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and compare the performance of distinctive ML models with conventional logistic regression (LR) model.Materials and Methods: In all, 3701 Chinese nondialysis CKD patients undergoing noncontrast cardiac computed tomography (CT) scanning were enrolled from November 2013 to December 2017. CAC score derived from the cardiac CT was calculated with the calcium scoring software and was used to assess and stratify the prevalence and severity of CAC. Four ML models (LR, random forest, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbor) and the corresponding feature ranks were conducted. The model that incorporated the independent predictors was shown as the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Area under the curve (AUC) was used to present the prediction value. ML model performance was compared with the traditional LR model using pairwise comparisons of AUCs.Results: Of the 3701 patients, 943 (25.5%) patients had CAC. Of the 943 patients with CAC, 764 patients (20.6%) and 179 patients (4.8%) had an Agatston CAC score of 1 to 300 and ≥300, respectively. The primary cohort and the independent validation cohort comprised 2957 patients and 744 patients, respectively. For the prevalence of CAC, the AUCs of ML models were from 0.78 to 0.82 in the training data set and the internal validation cohort. For the severity of CAC, the AUCs of the 4 ML models were from 0.67 to 0.70 in the training data set and from 0.53 to 0.70 in the internal validation cohort. For the prevalence of CAC, the AUC was 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.77-0.83) for ML (LR) versus 0.80 (95% CI: 0.77-0.83) for the traditional LR model ( P =0.2533). For the severity of CAC, the AUC was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.63-0.77) for ML (LR) versus 0.70 (95% CI: 0.63-0.77) for traditional LR model ( P =0.982).Conclusions: This study constructed prediction models for the presence and severity of CAC based on Agatston scores derived from noncontrast cardiac CT scanning in nondialysis CKD patients using ML, and showed ML LR had the best performance.

AB  - Our aim was to assess the tomographic presence of diabetic macular edema in type 2 diabetes patients screened for diabetic retinopathy with color fundus photographs and an artificial intelligence algorithm. Color fundus photographs obtained with a low-cost smartphone-based handheld retinal camera were analyzed by the algorithm; patients with suspected macular lesions underwent ocular coherence tomography. A total of 366 patients were screened; diabetic macular edema was suspected in 34 and confirmed in 29 individuals, with average age 60.5 ± 10.9 years and glycated hemoglobin 9.8 ± 2.4%; use of insulin, statins, and aspirin were reported in 44.8%, 37.9%, and 34.5% of individuals, respectively; systemic blood hypertension, dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, chronic kidney disease, and risk for diabetic foot ulcers were present in 100%, 58.6%, 62.1%, 48.3%, and 27.5% of individuals, respectively. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy was present in 31% of patients with macular edema; severity level was associated with albuminuria (p = 0.028). Eyes with macular edema had average central macular thickness 329.89 ± 80.98 m μ ; intraretinal cysts, sub retinal fluid, hyper-reflective foci, epiretinal membrane, and vitreomacular traction were found in 87.2%, 6.4%, 85.1%, 10.6%, and 6.4% of eyes, respectively. Diabetic retinopathy screening overwhelms health systems and is typically based on color fundus photographs, with high false-positive rates for the detection of diabetic macular edema. The present, semi-automated strategy comprising artificial intelligence algorithms integrated with smartphone-based retinal cameras could improve screening in low-resource settings with limited availability of ocular coherence tomography, allowing increased access rates and ultimately contributing to tackle preventable blindness.

The core first step for all NLP algorithms is preprocessing the text to identify the core words that differentiate the text while filtering out the noise. Traditional NLP uses a rule-based approach, applying grammatical rules to infer meaning from the text. Newer NLP approaches use machine learning/deep learning which can infer meaning without explicitly being programmed. NLP use in nephrology research has focused on identifying distinct disease processes, such as CKD, and extraction of patient-oriented outcomes such as symptoms with high sensitivity. NLP can identify patient features from clinical text associated with acute kidney injury and progression of CKD. Lastly, inclusion of features extracted using NLP improved the performance of risk-prediction models compared to models that only use structured data. Implementation of NLP algorithms has been slow, partially hindered by the lack of external validation of NLP algorithms. However, NLP allows for extraction of key patient characteristics from free text, an infrequently used resource in nephrology.

AB  - Although ultrasound plays an important role in the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD), image interpretation requires extensive training. High operator variability and limited image quality control of ultrasound images have made the application of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) challenging. This study assessed the effect of integrating computer-extracted measurable features with the convolutional neural network (CNN) on the ultrasound image CAD accuracy of CKD. Ultrasound images from patients who visited Severance Hospital and Gangnam Severance Hospital in South Korea between 2011 and 2018 were used. A Mask regional CNN model was used for organ segmentation and measurable feature extraction. Data on kidney length and kidney-to-liver echogenicity ratio were extracted. The ResNet18 model classified kidney ultrasound images into CKD and non-CKD. Experiments were conducted with and without the input of the measurable feature data. The performance of each model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). A total of 909 patients (mean age, 51.4 ± 19.3 years; 414 [49.5%] men and 495 [54.5%] women) were included in the study. The average AUROC from the model trained using ultrasound images achieved a level of 0.81. Image training with the integration of automatically extracted kidney length and echogenicity features revealed an improved average AUROC of 0.88. This value further increased to 0.91 when the clinical information of underlying diabetes was also included in the model trained with CNN and measurable features. The automated step-wise machine learning–aided model segmented, measured, and classified the kidney ultrasound images with high performance. The integration of computer-extracted measurable features into the machine learning model may improve CKD classification.

AB  - Background: We sought to use deep learning to extract anatomic features from postnatal kidney ultrasounds and evaluate their performance in predicting the risk and timing of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression for boys with posterior urethral valves (PUV). We hypothesized that these features would predict CKD progression better than clinical characteristics such as nadir creatinine alone. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of boys with PUV treated at two pediatric health systems from 1990 to 2021. Features of kidneys were extracted from initial postnatal kidney ultrasound images using a deep learning model. Three time-to-event prediction models were built using random survival forests. The Imaging Model included deep learning imaging features, the Clinical Model included clinical data, and the Ensemble Model combined imaging features and clinical data. Separate models were built to include time-dependent clinical data that were available at 6 months, 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years. Results: Two-hundred and twenty-five patients were included in the analysis. All models performed well with C-indices of 0.7 or greater. The Clinical Model outperformed the Imaging Model at all time points with nadir creatinine driving the performance of the Clinical Model. Combining the 6-month Imaging Model (C-index 0.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6, 0.79) with the 6-month Clinical Model (C-index 0.79; 95% CI 0.71, 0.86) resulted in a 6-month Ensemble Model that performed better (C-index 0.82; 95% CI 0.77, 0.88) than either model alone. Conclusions: Deep learning imaging features extracted from initial postnatal kidney ultrasounds may improve early prediction of CKD progression among children with PUV.

AB  - Background: Electronic health records can be used for population-wide identification and monitoring of disease. The Territory Kidney Care project developed algorithms to identify individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and several commonly comorbid chronic diseases. This study aims to describe the development and validation of our algorithms for CKD, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. A secondary aim of the study was to describe data completeness of the Territory Kidney Care database.Methods: The Territory Kidney Care database consolidates electronic health records from multiple health services including public hospitals (n = 6) and primary care health services (> 60) across the Northern Territory, Australia. Using the database (n = 48,569) we selected a stratified random sample of patients (n = 288), which included individuals with mild to end-stage CKD. Diagnostic accuracy of the algorithms was tested against blinded manual chart reviews. Data completeness of the database was also described.Results: For CKD defined as CKD stage 1 or higher (eGFR of any level with albuminuria or persistent eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.732, including renal replacement therapy) overall algorithm sensitivity was 93% (95%CI 89 to 96%) and specificity was 73% (95%CI 64 to 82%). For CKD defined as CKD stage 3a or higher (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.732) algorithm sensitivity and specificity were 93% and 97% respectively. Among the CKD 1 to 5 staging algorithms, the CKD stage 5 algorithm was most accurate with > 99% sensitivity and specificity. For related comorbidities - algorithm sensitivity and specificity results were 75% and 97% for diabetes; 85% and 88% for hypertension; and 79% and 96% for cardiovascular disease.Conclusions: We developed and validated algorithms to identify CKD and related chronic diseases within electronic health records. Validation results showed that CKD algorithms have a high degree of diagnostic accuracy compared to traditional administrative codes. Our highly accurate algorithms present new opportunities in early kidney disease detection, monitoring, and epidemiological research.

AB  - Background: Kidney disease progression rates vary among patients. Rapid and accurate prediction of kidney disease outcomes is crucial for disease management. In recent years, various prediction models using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been established in nephrology. However, their accuracy have been inconsistent. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of ML algorithms for kidney disease progression.Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Chinese Biomedicine Literature Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, and the VIP Database for diagnostic studies on ML algorithms' accuracy in predicting kidney disease prognosis, from the establishment of these databases until October 2020. Two investigators independently evaluate study quality by QUADAS-2 tool and extracted data from single ML algorithm for data synthesis using the bivariate model and the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model.Results: Fifteen studies were left after screening, only 6 studies were eligible for data synthesis. The sample size of these 6 studies was 12,534, and the kidney disease types could be divided into chronic kidney disease (CKD) and Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy, with 5 articles using end-stage renal diseases occurrence as the primary outcome. The main results indicated that the area under curve (AUC) of the HSROC was 0.87 (0.84-0.90) and ML algorithm exhibited a strong specificity, 95% confidence interval and heterogeneity (I2) of (0.87, 0.84-0.90, [I2 99.0%]) and a weak sensitivity of (0.68, 0.58-0.77, [I2 99.7%]) in predicting kidney disease deterioration. And the the results of subgroup analysis indicated that ML algorithm's AUC for predicting CKD prognosis was 0.82 (0.79-0.85), with the pool sensitivity of (0.64, 0.49-0.77, [I2 99.20%]) and pool specificity of (0.84, 0.74-0.91, [I2 99.84%]). The ML algorithm's AUC for predicting IgA nephropathy prognosis was 0.78 (0.74-0.81), with the pool sensitivity of (0.74, 0.71-0.77, [I2 7.10%]) and pool specificity of (0.93, 0.91-0.95, [I2 83.92%]).Conclusion: Taking advantage of big data, ML algorithm-based prediction models have high accuracy in predicting kidney disease progression, we recommend ML algorithms as an auxiliary tool for clinicians to determine proper treatment and disease management strategies.

AB  - Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a complex syndrome without a definitive treatment. For these patients, insulin resistance (IR) is associated with worse renal and patient outcomes. Until now, no predictive model using machine learning (ML) has been reported on IR in CKD patients. Methods: The CKD population studied was based on results from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) of the USA from 1999 to 2012. The homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) was used to assess insulin resistance. We began the model building process via the ML algorithm (random forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost), logistic regression algorithms, and deep neural learning (DNN)). We compared different receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves from different algorithms. Finally, we used SHAP values (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain how the different ML models worked. Results: In this study population, 71,916 participants were enrolled. Finally, we analyzed 1,229 of these participants. Their data were segregated into the IR group (HOMA IR > 3, n = 572) or non-IR group (HOMR IR ≤ 3, n = 657). In the validation group, RF had a higher accuracy (0.77), specificity (0.81), PPV (0.77), and NPV (0.77). In the test group, XGboost had a higher AUC of ROC (0.78). In addition, XGBoost also had a higher accuracy (0.7) and NPV (0.71). RF had a higher accuracy (0.7), specificity (0.78), and PPV (0.7). In the RF algorithm, the body mass index had a much larger impact on IR (0.1654), followed by triglyceride (0.0117), the daily calorie intake (0.0602), blood HDL value (0.0587), and age (0.0446). As for the SHAP value, in the RF algorithm, almost all features were well separated to show a positive or negative association with IR. Conclusion: This was the first study using ML to predict IR in patients with CKD. Our results showed that the RF algorithm had the best AUC of ROC and the best SHAP value differentiation. This was also the first study that included both macronutrients and micronutrients. We concluded that ML algorithms, particularly RF, can help determine risk factors and predict IR in patients with CKD.

AB  - Background: Tolvaptan was approved in the United States in 2018 for patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) at risk of rapid progression as assessed in a 3-year phase 3 clinical trial (TEMPO 3:4). An extension study (TEMPO 4:4) showed continued delay in progression at 2 years, and a trial in patients with later-stage disease (REPRISE) provided confirmatory evidence of efficacy. Given the relatively shorter-term duration of the clinical trials, estimating the longer-term benefit associated with tolvaptan via extrapolation of the treatment effect is an important undertaking.Methods: A model was developed to simulate a cohort of patients with ADPKD at risk of rapid progression and predict their long-term outcomes using an algorithm organized around the Mayo Risk Classification system, which has five subclasses (1A through 1E) based on estimated kidney growth rates. The model base-case population represents 1280 patients enrolled in TEMPO 3:4 beginning in chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages G1, G2, and G3 across Mayo subclasses 1C, 1D, and 1E. The algorithm was used to predict longer-term natural history health outcomes. The estimated treatment effect of tolvaptan from TEMPO 3:4 was applied to the natural history to predict the longer-term treatment benefit of tolvaptan. For the cohort, analyzed once reflecting natural history and once assuming treatment with tolvaptan, the model estimated lifetime progression through CKD stages, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and death.Results: When treated with tolvaptan, the model cohort was predicted to experience a 3.1-year delay of ESRD (95% confidence interval: 1.8 to 4.4), approximately a 23% improvement over the estimated 13.7 years for patients not receiving tolvaptan. Patients beginning tolvaptan treatment in CKD stages G1, G2, and G3 were predicted to experience estimated delays of ESRD, compared with patients not receiving tolvaptan, of 3.8 years (21% improvement), 3.0 years (24% improvement), and 2.1 years (28% improvement), respectively.Conclusions: The model estimated that patients treated with tolvaptan versus no treatment spent more time in earlier CKD stages and had later onset of ESRD. Findings highlight the potential long-term value of early intervention with tolvaptan in patients at risk of rapid ADPKD progression.

AB  - We reviewed some of the latest advancements in the use of mathematical models in nephrology. We looked over 2 distinct categories of mathematical models that are widely used in biological research and pointed out some of their strengths and weaknesses when applied to health care, especially in the context of nephrology. A mechanistic dynamical system allows the representation of causal relations among the system variables but with a more complex and longer development/implementation phase. Artificial intelligence/machine learning provides predictive tools that allow identifying correlative patterns in large data sets, but they are usually harder-to-interpret black boxes. Chronic kidney disease (CKD), a major worldwide health problem, generates copious quantities of data that can be leveraged by choice of the appropriate model; also, there is a large number of dialysis parameters that need to be determined at every treatment session that can benefit from predictive mechanistic models. Following important steps in the use of mathematical methods in medical science might be in the intersection of seemingly antagonistic frameworks, by leveraging the strength of each to provide better care.

AB  - Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Prognostic biomarkers reflective of underlying molecular mechanisms are critically needed for effective management of DKD. A three-marker panel was derived from a proteomics analysis of plasma samples by an unbiased machine learning approach from participants (N = 58) in the Clinical Phenotyping and Resource Biobank study. In combination with standard clinical parameters, this panel improved prediction of the composite outcome of ESKD or a 40% decline in glomerular filtration rate. The panel was validated in an independent group (N = 68), who also had kidney transcriptomic profiles. One marker, plasma angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2), was significantly associated with outcomes in cohorts from the Cardiovascular Health Study (N = 3,183) and the Chinese Cohort Study of Chronic Kidney Disease (N = 210). Glomerular transcriptional angiopoietin/Tie (ANG-TIE) pathway scores, derived from the expression of 154 ANG-TIE signaling mediators, correlated positively with plasma ANGPT2 levels and kidney outcomes. Higher receptor expression in glomeruli and higher ANG-TIE pathway scores in endothelial cells corroborated potential functional effects in the kidney from elevated plasma ANGPT2 levels. Our work suggests that ANGPT2 is a promising prognostic endothelial biomarker with likely functional impact on glomerular pathogenesis in DKD.

AB  - Calciphylaxis is a calcific uraemic arteriolopathy that is observed in patients with end-stage renal disease. Its pathophysiology remains uncertain. The end result is calcium deposition in the medial layer of small-sized arteries and arterioles leading to painful skin ulcers. Approximately half of the patients die within a year of diagnosis with sepsis being the commonest cause. Treatment options are limited. However, intravenous sodium thiosulphate and bisphosphonates seem to be successful in controlling the disease progression in some cases. Wound care and surgical debridement remain the main stay of prevention of secondary infections. We share our experience with three cases over the past year, the need to keep this differential diagnosis in mind when treating lesions that appear "ischemic" and suggest an algorithm for diagnosis and management.

AB  - Chronic disease identification and management is a significant issue in Australia, with general practice being the primary contact point for those at risk of, or living with, chronic disease. However, there is a well-described gap between guideline recommendations for chronic disease management and translation in the general practice setting. In 2018, a group of researchers, clinicians and software developers collaborated to develop a tool to support the identification and management of chronic disease in general practice, with the aim to create a platform that met the needs of general practice. The co-design process drew together core principles and expectations for the establishment of a technological platform, called Future Health Today (FHT), which would sit alongside the electronic medical record (EMR) management system within general practice. FHT used algorithms applied to EMR data to identify patients with, or at risk of, chronic disease and requiring review. Using chronic kidney disease as a clinical focus, the FHT prototype was piloted in a large, metropolitan general practice, and a large regional general practice. Based on user feedback, the prototype was further developed and improved. This paper provides a report on the key features and functionalities that participants identified and implemented in practice. Future Health Today is a new platform, co-designed by general practice for general practice, which aims to streamline the identification and management of chronic disease to improve health outcomes. This paper describes the development of the technology platform and how it was optimised through an implementation study in general practice.

AB  - Background: Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is routinely performed in children with chronic kidney disease to identify masked hypertension, a risk factor for accelerated chronic kidney disease progression. However, ABPM is burdensome, and developing an accurate prediction of masked hypertension may allow using ABPM selectively rather than routinely.Methods: To create a prediction model for masked hypertension using clinic blood pressure (BP) and other clinical characteristics, we analyzed 809 ABPM studies with nonhypertensive clinic BP among the participants of the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children study.Results: Masked hypertension was identified in 170 (21.0%) observations. We created prediction models for masked hypertension via gradient boosting, random forests, and logistic regression using 109 candidate predictors and evaluated its performance using bootstrap validation. The models showed C statistics from 0.660 (95% CI, 0.595-0.707) to 0.732 (95% CI, 0.695-0.786) and Brier scores from 0.148 (95% CI, 0.141-0.154) to 0.167 (95% CI, 0.152-0.183). Using the possible thresholds identified from this model, we stratified the dataset by clinic systolic/diastolic BP percentiles. The prevalence of masked hypertension was the lowest (4.8%) when clinic systolic/diastolic BP were both <20th percentile, and relatively low (9.0%) with clinic systolic BP<20th and diastolic BP<80th percentiles. Above these thresholds, the prevalence was higher with no discernable pattern.Conclusions: ABPM could be used selectively in those with low clinic BP, for example, systolic BP<20th and diastolic BP<80th percentiles, although careful assessment is warranted as masked hypertension was not completely absent even in this subgroup. Above these clinic BP levels, routine ABPM remains recommended.

AB  - Hyperkalemia is associated with increased risks of mortality and adverse clinical outcomes. The treatment of hyperkalemia often leads to the discontinuation or restriction of beneficial but potassium-increasing therapy such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors (RAASi) and high-potassium diet including fruits and vegetables. To date, limited evidence is available for personalized risk evaluation in this heterogeneous and multifactorial pathophysiological condition. We developed risk prediction models using extreme gradient boosting (XGB), multiple logistic regression (LR), and deep neural network. Models were derived from a retrospective cohort of hyperkalemic patients with either heart failure or chronic kidney disease stage ≥3a from a Japanese nationwide database (1 April 2008–30 September 2018). Studied outcomes included all-cause death, renal replacement therapy introduction (RRT), hospitalization for heart failure (HHF), and cardiovascular events within three years after hyperkalemic episodes. The best performing model was further validated using an external cohort. A total of 24,949 adult hyperkalemic patients were selected for model derivation and internal validation. A total of 1452 deaths (16.6%), 887 RRT (10.1%), 1,345 HHF (15.4%), and 621 cardiovascular events (7.1%) were observed. XGB outperformed other models. The area under receiver operator characteristic curves (AUROCs) of XGB vs. LR (95% CIs) for death, RRT, HHF, and cardiovascular events were 0.823 (0.805–0.841) vs. 0.809 (0.791–0.828), 0.957 (0.947–0.967) vs. 0.947 (0.936–0.959), 0.863 (0.846–0.880) vs. 0.838 (0.820–0.856), and 0.809 (0.784–0.834) vs. 0.798 (0.772–0.823), respectively. In the external dataset including 86,279 patients, AUROCs (95% CIs) for XGB were: death, 0.747 (0.742–0.753); RRT, 0.888 (0.882–0.894); HHF, 0.673 (0.666–0.679); and cardiovascular events, 0.585 (0.578–0.591). Kaplan–Meier curves of the high-risk predicted group showed a statistically significant difference from that of the low-risk predicted groups for all outcomes (p < 0.005; log-rank test). These findings suggest possible use of machine learning models for real-world risk assessment as a guide for observation and/or treatment decision making that may potentially lead to improved outcomes in hyperkalemic patients while retaining the benefit of life-saving therapies.

AB  - Objective. Tripterygium wilfordii polyglycosides tablet (TGt) is an oral preparation extracted from plant Tripterygium wilfordii. It has the effects of anti-inflammation and inhibition of cellular and humoral immunity. However, many reports of adverse reactions caused by TGt have limited its application. In this paper, the clinical efficacy and safety of TGt in the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) were verified by data mining and analysis, so as to provide theoretical data support for the application and development of TGt. Methods. A computer search of the following databases was conducted: PubMed, Web of Science, CBM, VIP, Wanfang Data, and CNKI. The search time limit is from the establishment of the database to September 2020. We searched for clinical randomized controlled trials of TGt in the treatment of CKD. The main types of CKD involved are nephrotic syndrome (NS), primary nephrotic syndrome (PNS), refractory nephrotic syndrome (RNS), and IgA nephropathy (IgAN). RevMan 5.2 and Stata 12.0 software were used to evaluate the literature quality and analyze the data. Finally, GRADEpro software was used to evaluate the quality of evidence. Results. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 75 articles with a total of 6418 subjects were included. The results of the meta-analysis showed that TGt could reduce 24-hour urinary protein, increase serum albumin, improve clinical efficacy, and reduce disease recurrence rate in patients (P < 0.05) with CKD compared with adrenocortical hormones or immunosuppressants. TGt could significantly reduce the level of serum creatinine (Scr) in patients with CKD (P < 0.05), but it was not significant in reducing the level of blood urea nitrogen (P > 0.05). In terms of safety evaluation, in patients with CKD, it could significantly reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions and neurogenic dizziness and headache (P < 0.05). However, in terms of adverse reactions such as liver injury, respiratory infection, and leukopenia, TGt was as harmful as corticosteroids or immunosuppressants (P < 0.05). The quality of the evidence was evaluated with GRADEpro software, and the results showed that TGt was strongly recommended for the treatment of CKD. Conclusion. TGt has certain efficacy in the treatment of CKD and has fewer side effects in certain types of diseases. The effect of TGt combined with other drugs is better than that of single use. This paper also has some limitations. Due to the limited number of the included studies, with all being from China, there may be methodological differences. Therefore, more high-quality literature data from different countries are needed.

AB  - Background: Lupus nephropathy (LN) occurs in approximately 50% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and 20% of them will eventually progress into end-stage renal disease (ESRD). A clinical tool predicting remission of proteinuria might be of utmost importance. In our work, we focused on predicting the chance of complete remission achievement in LN patients, using artificial intelligence models, especially an artificial neural network, called the multi-layer perceptron.Methods: It was a single centre retrospective study, including 58 individuals, with diagnosed systemic lupus erythematous and biopsy proven lupus nephritis. Patients were assigned into the study cohort, between 1st January 2010 and 31st December 2020, and eventually randomly allocated either to the training set (N = 46) or testing set (N = 12). The end point was remission achievement. We have selected an array of variables, subsequently reduced to the optimal minimum set, providing the best performance.Results: We have obtained satisfactory results creating predictive models allowing to assess, with accuracy of 91.67%, a chance of achieving a complete remission, with a high discriminant ability (AUROC 0.9375).Conclusion: Our solution allows an accurate assessment of complete remission achievement and monitoring of patients from the group with a lower probability of complete remission. The obtained models are scalable and can be improved by introducing new patient records.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Risk stratification for chronic kidney is becoming increasingly important as a clinical tool for both treatment and prevention measures. The goal of this review is to identify how machine learning tools contribute and facilitate risk stratification in the clinical setting.Recent Findings: The two key machine learning paradigms to predictively stratify kidney disease risk are genomics-based and electronic health record based approaches. These methods can provide both quantitative information such as relative risk and qualitative information such as characterizing risk by subphenotype.Summary: The four key methods to stratify chronic kidney disease risk are genomics, multiomics, supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. Polygenic risk scores utilize whole genome sequencing data to generate an individual's relative risk compared with the population. Multiomic methods integrate information from multiple biomarkers to generate trajectories and prognostic different outcomes. Supervised machine learning methods can directly utilize the growing compendia of electronic health records such as laboratory results and notes to generate direct risk predictions, while unsupervised machine learning methods can cluster individuals with chronic kidney disease into subphenotypes with differing approaches to care.

AB  - Background: Noninvasively predicting kidney tubulointerstitial fibrosis is important because it's closely correlated with the development and prognosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Most studies of shear wave elastography (SWE) in CKD were limited to non-linear statistical dependencies and didn't fully consider variables' interactions. Therefore, support vector machine (SVM) of machine learning was used to assess the prediction value of SWE and traditional ultrasound techniques in kidney fibrosis.Methods: We consecutively recruited 117 CKD patients with kidney biopsy. SWE, B-mode, color Doppler flow imaging ultrasound and hematological exams were performed on the day of kidney biopsy. Kidney tubulointerstitial fibrosis was graded by semi-quantification of Masson staining. The diagnostic performances were accessed by ROC analysis.Results: Tubulointerstitial fibrosis area was significantly correlated with eGFR among CKD patients (R = 0.450, P < 0.001). AUC of SWE, combined with B-mode and blood flow ultrasound by SVM, was 0.8303 (sensitivity, 77.19%; specificity, 71.67%) for diagnosing tubulointerstitial fibrosis (>10%), higher than either traditional ultrasound, or SWE (AUC, 0.6735 [sensitivity, 67.74%; specificity, 65.45%]; 0.5391 [sensitivity, 55.56%; specificity, 53.33%] respectively. Delong test, p < 0.05); For diagnosing different grades of tubulointerstitial fibrosis, SWE combined with traditional ultrasound by SVM, had AUCs of 0.6429 for mild tubulointerstitial fibrosis (11%-25%), and 0.9431 for moderate to severe tubulointerstitial fibrosis (>50%), higher than other methods (Delong test, p < 0.05).Conclusion: SWE with SVM modeling could improve the diagnostic performance of traditional kidney ultrasound in predicting different kidney tubulointerstitial fibrosis grades among CKD patients.

AB  - There is a need for a reliable and validated method to estimate dietary potassium intake in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients to improve prevention of cardiovascular complications. This study aimed to develop a clinical tool to estimate potassium intake using 24-h urinary potassium excretion as a surrogate of dietary potassium intake in this high-risk population. Data of 375 adult CKD-patients routinely collecting their 24-h urine were included to develop a prediction tool to estimate potassium diet. The prediction tool was built from a random sample of 80% of patients and validated on the remaining 20%. The accuracy of the prediction tool to classify potassium diet in the three classes of potassium excretion was 74%. Surprisingly, the variables related to potassium consumption were more related to clinical characteristics and renal pathology than to the potassium content of the ingested food. Artificial intelligence allowed to develop an easy-to-use tool for estimating patients' diets in clinical practice. After external validation, this tool could be extended to all CKD-patients for a better clinical and therapeutic management for the prevention of cardiovascular complications.

AB  - Background: Laboratory tests are obtained following total joint arthroplasty (TJA) despite a lack of supporting evidence. No prior study has prospectively analyzed the effect of discontinuing routine laboratory tests. This study aimed to determine whether discontinuing routine laboratory tests in TJA patients resulted in a difference in 90-day complications.Methods: This was a prospective protocol change study at a high-volume center. Prior to protocol change, patients underwent routine laboratory tests following primary unilateral TJA (control group). After the change, an algorithmic approach was used to selectively order laboratory tests (protocol group). Patients with bleeding disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic renal failure, dementia, abnormal preoperative sodium, potassium, or hemoglobin <10 g/dL were excluded. In-hospital and 90-day data were collected. Student's t-test was used to analyze continuous variables and chi-squared test was used for categorical variables. A pre-hoc analysis examining the primary outcome required 607 patients per group to achieve 80% power.Results: The protocol group included 937 patients, whereas the control group included 891 patients. The protocol group had fewer females and total hip arthroplasties. There were no differences in age, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, tranexamic acid administration, or estimated blood loss between the protocol and control groups. There were also no differences in transfusions, electrolyte corrections, unplanned consults, length of stay, or transfers. The protocol cohort had more fluid boluses and home discharges. There was no difference in 90-day complications between the 2 groups.Conclusions: This study utilizing an algorithmic approach to laboratory collection demonstrates that discontinuing routine laboratory tests following TJA is safe and effective. We believe this protocol can be implemented for most patients undergoing primary unilateral TJA.

AB  - This study developed an office-based cardiovascular risk calculator using a machine learning (ML) algorithm that utilized a focused carotid ultrasound. The design of this study was divided into three steps. The first step involved collecting 18 office-based biomarkers consisting of six clinical risk factors (age, sex, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and smoking) and 12 carotid ultrasound image-based phenotypes. The second step consisted of the design of an ML-based cardiovascular risk calculator-called “AtheroEdge Composite Risk Score 2.0” (AECRS2.0ML) for risk stratification, considering chronic kidney disease (CKD) as the surrogate endpoint of cardiovascular disease. The last step consisted of comparing AECRS2.0ML against the currently utilized office-based CVD calculators, namely the Framingham risk score (FRS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) risk scores. A cohort of 379 Asian-Indian patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease (stage 1 to 5) were recruited for this cross-sectional study. From this retrospective cohort, 758 ultrasound scan images were acquired from the far walls of the left and right common carotid arteries [mean age = 55 ± 10.8 years, 67.28% males, 91.82% diabetic, 86.54% hypertensive, and 83.11% with CKD]. The mean office-based cardiovascular risk estimates using FRS and WHO calculators were 26% and 19%, respectively. AECRS2.0ML demonstrated a better risk stratification ability having a higher area-under-the-curve against FRS and WHO by ~30% (0.871 vs. 0.669) and ~ 20% (0.871 vs. 0.727), respectively. The office-based machine-learning cardiovascular risk-stratification tool (AECRS2.0ML) shows superior performance compared to currently available conventional cardiovascular risk calculators.

AB  - Background. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has long been used to treat chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Asia. Its effectiveness and safety for CKD treatment have been confirmed in documented studies. However, the prescription rule of formulae for Chinese medicinal herbs is complicated and remains uncharacterized. Thus, we used data mining technology to evaluate the treatment principle and coprescription pattern of these formulae in CKD TCM treatment. Methods. Data on patients with CKD were obtained from the outpatient system of a TCM hospital. We established a Chinese herb knowledge base based on the Chinese Pharmacopoeia and the Chinese Materia Medica. Then, following extraction of prescription information, we deweighted and standardized each prescribed herb according to the knowledge base to establish a database of CKD treatment formulae. We analyzed the frequency with which individual herbs were prescribed, as well as their properties, tastes, meridian tropisms, and categories. Then, we evaluated coprescription patterns and assessed medication rules by performing association rule learning, cluster analysis, and complex network analysis. Results. We retrospectively analyzed 299 prescriptions of 166 patients with CKD receiving TCM treatment. The most frequently prescribed core herbs for CKD treatment were Rhizoma Dioscoreae (Shanyao), Spreading Hedyotis Herb (Baihuasheshecao), Root of Snow of June (Baimagu), Radix Astragali (Huangqi), Poria (Fulin), Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae (Baizhu), Radix Pseudostellariae (Taizishen), and Fructus Corni (Shanzhuyu). The TCM properties of the herbs were mainly being warm, mild, and cold. The tastes of the herbs were mainly sweet, followed by bitter. The main meridian tropisms were Spleen Meridian of Foot-Taiyin, Liver Meridian of Foot-Jueyi, Lung Meridian of Hand-Taiyin, Stomach Meridian of Foot-Yangming, and Kidney Meridian of Foot-Shaoyin. The top three categories were deficiency-tonifying, heat-clearing, and dampness-draining diuretic. Conclusion. Using an integrated analysis method, we confirmed that the primary TCM pathogeneses of kidney disease were deficiency and dampness-heat. The primary treatment principles were tonifying deficiency and eliminating dampness-heat.

AB  - This article describes the articulation, development, and deployment of a machine learning (ML) model-driven value solution for chronic kidney disease (CKD) in a health system. The ML model activated an electronic medical record (EMR) trigger that alerted CKD patients to seek primary care. Simultaneously, primary care physicians (PCPs) received an alert that a CKD patient needed an appointment. Using structured checklists, PCPs addressed and controlled comorbid conditions, reconciled drug dosing and choice to CKD stage, and ordered prespecified laboratory and imaging tests pertinent to CKD. After completion of checklist prescribed tasks, PCPs referred patients to nephrology. CKD patients had multiple comorbidities and ML recognition of CKD provided a facile insight into comorbid burden. Operational results of this program have exceeded expectations and the program is being expanded to the entire health system. This paradigm of ML-driven, checklist-enabled care can be used agnostic of EMR platform to deliver value in CKD through structured engagement of complexity in health systems.

AB  - Importance: Interindividual variability in postprandial glycemic response (PPGR) to the same foods may explain why low glycemic index or load and low-carbohydrate diet interventions have mixed weight loss outcomes. A precision nutrition approach that estimates personalized PPGR to specific foods may be more efficacious for weight loss. Objective: To compare a standardized low-fat vs a personalized diet regarding percentage of weight loss in adults with abnormal glucose metabolism and obesity. Design, setting, and participants: The Personal Diet Study was a single-center, population-based, 6-month randomized clinical trial with measurements at baseline (0 months) and 3 and 6 months conducted from February 12, 2018, to October 28, 2021. A total of 269 adults aged 18 to 80 years with a body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) ranging from 27 to 50 and a hemoglobin A1c level ranging from 5.7% to 8.0% were recruited. Individuals were excluded if receiving medications other than metformin or with evidence of kidney disease, assessed as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation, to avoid recruiting patients with advanced type 2 diabetes. Interventions: Participants were randomized to either a low-fat diet (<25% of energy intake; standardized group) or a personalized diet that estimates PPGR to foods using a machine learning algorithm (personalized group). Participants in both groups received a total of 14 behavioral counseling sessions and self-monitored dietary intake. In addition, the participants in the personalized group received color-coded meal scores on estimated PPGR delivered via a mobile app. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was the percentage of weight loss from baseline to 6 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in body composition (fat mass, fat-free mass, and percentage of body weight), resting energy expenditure, and adaptive thermogenesis. Data were collected at baseline and 3 and 6 months. Analysis was based on intention to treat using linear mixed modeling. Results: Of a total of 204 adults randomized, 199 (102 in the personalized group vs 97 in the standardized group) contributed data (mean [SD] age, 58 [11] years; 133 women [66.8%]; mean [SD] body mass index, 33.9 [4.8]). Weight change at 6 months was -4.31% (95% CI, -5.37% to -3.24%) for the standardized group and -3.26% (95% CI, -4.25% to -2.26%) for the personalized group, which was not significantly different (difference between groups, 1.05% [95% CI, -0.40% to 2.50%]; P = .16). There were no between-group differences in body composition and adaptive thermogenesis; however, the change in resting energy expenditure was significantly greater in the standardized group from 0 to 6 months (difference between groups, 92.3 [95% CI, 0.9-183.8] kcal/d; P = .05). Conclusions and relevance: A personalized diet targeting a reduction in PPGR did not result in greater weight loss compared with a low-fat diet at 6 months. Future studies should assess methods of increasing dietary self-monitoring adherence and intervention exposure.

AB  - Data mining involves the use of mathematical sciences, statistics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to determine the relationships between variables from a large sample of data. It has previously been shown that data mining can improve the prediction and diagnostic precision of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A few studies have applied machine learning to assess hypertension and metabolic syndrome-related biomarkers, as well as refine the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Machine learning methods have also been applied to assess new biomarkers and survival outcomes in patients with renal diseases to predict the development of chronic kidney disease, disease progression, and renal graft survival. In the latter, random forest methods were found to be the best for the prediction of chronic kidney disease. Some studies have investigated the prognosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and acute liver failure, as well as therapy response prediction in patients with viral disorders, using decision tree models. Machine learning techniques, such as Sparse High-Order Interaction Model with Rejection Option, have been used for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. Data mining techniques have also been applied to identify the risk factors for serious mental illness, such as depression and dementia, and help to diagnose and predict the quality of life of such patients. In relation to child health, some studies have determined the best algorithms for predicting obesity and malnutrition. Machine learning has determined the important risk factors for preterm birth and low birth weight. Published studies of patients with cancer and bacterial diseases are limited and should perhaps be addressed more comprehensively in future studies. Herein, we provide an in-depth review of studies in which biochemical biomarker data were analyzed using machine learning methods to assess the risk of several common diseases, in order to summarize the potential applications of data mining methods in clinical diagnosis. Data mining techniques have now been increasingly applied to clinical diagnostics, and they have the potential to support this field.

AB  - Kidney pathophysiology is often complex, nonlinear and heterogeneous, which limits the utility of hypothetical-deductive reasoning and linear, statistical approaches to diagnosis and treatment. Emerging evidence suggests that artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled decision support systems - which use algorithms based on learned examples - may have an important role in nephrology. Contemporary AI applications can accurately predict the onset of acute kidney injury before notable biochemical changes occur; can identify modifiable risk factors for chronic kidney disease onset and progression; can match or exceed human accuracy in recognizing renal tumours on imaging studies; and may augment prognostication and decision-making following renal transplantation. Future AI applications have the potential to make real-time, continuous recommendations for discrete actions and yield the greatest probability of achieving optimal kidney health outcomes. Realizing the clinical integration of AI applications will require cooperative, multidisciplinary commitment to ensure algorithm fairness, overcome barriers to clinical implementation, and build an AI-competent workforce. AI-enabled decision support should preserve the pre-eminence of wisdom and augment rather than replace human decision-making. By anchoring intuition with objective predictions and classifications, this approach should favour clinician intuition when it is honed by experience.

AB  - Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is responsible for large personal health and societal burdens. Screening populations at higher risk for CKD is effective to initiate earlier treatment and decelerate disease progress. We externally validated clinical prediction models for unknown CKD that might be used in population screening.Methods: We validated six risk models for prediction of CKD using only non-invasive parameters. Validation data came from 4,185 participants of the German Heinz-Nixdorf-Recall study (HNR), drawn in 2000 from a general population aged 45-75 years. We estimated discrimination and calibration using the full model information, and calculated the diagnostic properties applying the published scoring algorithms of the models using various thresholds for the sum of scores.Results: The risk models used four to nine parameters. Age and hypertension were included in all models. Five out of six c-values ranged from 0.71 to 0.73, indicating fair discrimination. Positive predictive values ranged from 15 to 19%, negative predictive values were > 93% using score thresholds that resulted in values for sensitivity and specificity above 60%.Conclusions: Most of the selected CKD prediction models show fair discrimination in a German general population. The estimated diagnostic properties indicate that the models are suitable for identifying persons at higher risk for unknown CKD without invasive procedures.

AB  - Background: No personalized prediction model or standardized algorithm exists to identify those at high risk of death among severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP) patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The aim of this study was to investigate the risk factors and to develop a useful nomogram for prediction of mortality in those patients.Methods: We performed a retrospective, observational, cohort study in the intensive care unit (ICU) of West China Hospital, Sichuan University with all consecutive SCAP patients with COPD between December 2011 and December 2018. The clinical data within 24 h of admission to ICU were collected. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. We divided the patients into training and testing cohorts (70% versus 30%) randomly. In the training cohort, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to identify independent risk factors applied to develop a nomogram. The prediction model was assessed in both training and testing cohorts.Results: Finally, 873 SCAP patients with COPD were included, among which the hospital mortality was 41.4%. In training cohort, the independent risk factors for hospital mortality were increased age, diabetes, chronic renal diseases, decreased systolic blood pressure (SBP), and elevated fibrinogen, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). The C index was 0.840 (95% CI 0.809-0.872) in training cohort and 0.830 (95% CI 0.781-0.878) in testing cohort. Furthermore, the time-dependent AUC, calibration plots, DCA and clinical impact curves indicated the model had good predictive performance. Significant association of risk stratification based on nomogram with mortality was also found (P for trend < 0.001). The restricted cubic splines suggested that estimated associations between these predictors and hospital mortality were all linear relationships.Conclusion: We developed a prediction model including seven risk factors for hospital mortality in patients with SCAP and COPD. It can be used for early risk stratification in clinical practice after more external validation.

AB  - Uremic pruritus (UP) is prevalent among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which causes severe itching and affects their quality of life. Additionally, patients experience fatigue and depression, and an increased risk of mortality has also been reported. A meta-analysis of 17 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has indicated that Chinese herbal bath therapy (CHBT) had adjuvant benefits in improving UP in ESRD patients, and previous studies have reported that herb combinations were more useful than treatment with a single herb. Association rule analysis has been used to evaluate potential correlations between herb combinations, and Apriori algorithms are one of the most powerful machine-learning algorithms available for identifying associations within databases. Therefore, we used the Apriori algorithm to analyze association rules of potential core herb combinations for use in CHBT for UP treatment using data from a meta-analysis of 17 RCTs that used CHBT for UP treatment. Data on 43 CHBT herbs were extracted from 17 RCTs included for analysis and we found 19 association rules. The results indicated that the following herb combinations {Chuanxiong, Baijili} ≥ {Dahuang} and {Dahuang, Baijili} ≥ {Chuanxiong} were most strongly associated, implying that these herb combinations represent potential CHBT treatments for UP.

AB  - Cardiovascular (CV) disease represents the most common cause of death in developed countries. Risk assessment is highly relevant to intervene at individual level and implement prevention strategies. Circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) are involved in the development and progression of CV diseases and are considered promising biomarkers. We aimed at identifying an EV signature to improve the stratification of patients according to CV risk and likelihood to develop fatal CV events. EVs were characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis and flow cytometry for a standardized panel of 37 surface antigens in a cross-sectional multicenter cohort (n = 486). CV profile was defined by presence of different indicators (age, sex, body mass index, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, coronary artery disease, cardiac heart failure, chronic kidney disease, smoking habit, organ damage) and according to the 10-year risk of fatal CV events estimated using SCORE charts of European Society of Cardiology. By combining expression levels of EV antigens using unsupervised learning, patients were classified into 3 clusters: Cluster-I (n = 288), Cluster-II (n = 83), Cluster-III (n = 30). A separate analysis was conducted on patients displaying acute CV events (n = 82). Prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, chronic heart failure, and organ damage (defined as left ventricular hypertrophy and/or microalbuminuria) increased progressively from Cluster-I to Cluster-III. Several EV antigens, including markers for platelets (CD41b-CD42a-CD62P), leukocytes (CD1c-CD2-CD3-CD4-CD8-CD14-CD19-CD20-CD25-CD40-CD45-CD69-CD86), and endothelium (CD31-CD105) were independently associated with CV risk indicators and correlated to age, blood pressure, glucometabolic profile, renal function, and SCORE risk. EV profiling, obtained from minimally invasive blood sampling, allows accurate patient stratification according to CV risk profile.

AB  - Background: Prediction of graft survival for Kidney Transplantation (KT) is considered a risky task due to the scarcity of donating organs and the use of health care resources. The present study aimed to design and evaluate a smartphone-based application to predict the survival of KT in patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD).Method: Based on the initial review, a researcher-made questionnaire was developed to assess the information needs of the application through urologists and nephrologists. By using information obtained from the questionnaire, a checklist was prepared, and the information of 513 patients with kidney failure was collected from their records at Sina Urological Research Center. Then, three data mining algorithms were applied to them. The smartphone-based application for the prediction of kidney transplant survival was designed, and a standard usability assessment questionnaire was used to evaluate the designed application.Results: Three information elements related to the required data in different sections of demographic information, sixteen information elements related to patient clinical information, and four critical capabilities were determined for the design of the smartphone-based application. C5.0 algorithm with the highest accuracy (87.21%) was modeled as the application inference engine. The application was developed based on the PhoneGap framework. According to the participants' scores (urologists and nephrologists) regarding the usability evaluation of the application, it can be concluded that both groups participating in the study could use the program, and they rated the application at a "good" level.Conclusion: Since the overall performance or usability of the smartphone-based app was evaluated at a reasonable level, it can be used with certainty to predict kidney transplant survival.

AB  - Background: While multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are available, their results may not be generalizable to older, unhealthier or less-adherent patients. Observational data can be used to predict outcomes and evaluate treatments; however, exactly which strategy should be used to analyze the outcomes of treatment using observational data is currently unclear. This study aimed to determine the most accurate machine learning technique to predict 1-year-after-initial-acute-myocardial-infarction (AMI) survival of elderly patients and to identify the association of angiotensin-converting- enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ACEi/ARBs) with survival.Methods: We built a cohort of 124,031 Medicare beneficiaries who experienced an AMI in 2007 or 2008. For analytical purposes, all variables were categorized into nine different groups: ACEi/ARB use, demographics, cardiac events, comorbidities, complications, procedures, medications, insurance, and healthcare utilization. Our outcome of interest was 1-year-post-AMI survival. To solve this classification task, we used lasso logistic regression (LLR) and random forest (RF), and compared their performance depending on category selection, sampling methods, and hyper-parameter selection. Nested 10-fold cross-validation was implemented to obtain an unbiased estimate of performance evaluation. We used the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) as our primary measure for evaluating the performance of predictive algorithms.Results: LLR consistently showed best AUC results throughout the experiments, closely followed by RF. The best prediction was yielded with LLR based on the combination of demographics, comorbidities, procedures, and utilization. The coefficients from the final LLR model showed that AMI patients with many comorbidities, older ages, or living in a low-income area have a higher risk of mortality 1-year after an AMI. In addition, treating the AMI patients with ACEi/ARBs increases the 1-year-after-initial-AMI survival rate of the patients.Conclusions: Given the many features we examined, ACEi/ARBs were associated with increased 1-year survival among elderly patients after an AMI. We found LLR to be the best-performing model over RF to predict 1-year survival after an AMI. LLR greatly improved the generalization of the model by feature selection, which implicitly indicates the association between AMI-related variables and survival can be defined by a relatively simple model with a small number of features. Some comorbidities were associated with a greater risk of mortality, such as heart failure and chronic kidney disease, but others were associated with survival such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. In addition, patients who live in urban areas and areas with large numbers of immigrants have a higher probability of survival. Machine learning methods are helpful to determine outcomes when RCT results are not available.

AB  - Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health problem. Identifying new biomarkers that can be used to calculate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) would greatly improve the diagnosis and understanding of CKD at the molecular level. A metabolomics study of blood samples derived from patients with widely divergent glomerular filtration rates could potentially discover small molecule metabolites associated with varying kidney function.Methods: Using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), serum was analyzed from 53 participants with a spectrum of measured GFR (by iohexol plasma clearance) ranging from normal to severe renal insufficiency. An untargeted metabolomics assay (N ¼ 214) was conducted at the Calibra-Metabolon Joint Laboratory.Results: From a large number of metabolomics-derived metabolites, the top 30 metabolites correlated to increasing renal insufficiency according to mGFR were selected by the random forest method. Significant differences in metabolite profiles with increasing stages of CKD were observed. Combining candidate lists from six other unique statistical analyses, six novel, potential metabolites that were reproducibly strongly associated with mGFR were selected, including erythronate, gulonate, C-glycosyltryptophan, N-acetylserine, N6-carbamoylthreonyladenosine, and pseudouridine. In addition, hydroxyasparagine were strongly associated with mGFR and CKD, which were unique to this study.Conclusions: Global metabolite profiling of serum yielded potentially valuable biomarkers of different stages of CKD. Additionally, these potential biomarkers might provide insight into the underlying pathophysiologic processes that contribute to the progression of CKD as well as improve GFR estimation.

AB  - BACKGROUNDIn human lupus nephritis (LN), tubulointerstitial inflammation (TII) on biopsy predicts progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, only about half of patients with moderate-to-severe TII develop ESRD. We hypothesized that this heterogeneity in outcome reflects different underlying inflammatory states. Therefore, we interrogated renal biopsies from LN longitudinal and cross-sectional cohorts.METHODSData were acquired using conventional and highly multiplexed confocal microscopy. To accurately segment cells across whole biopsies, and to understand their spatial relationships, we developed computational pipelines by training and implementing several deep-learning models and other computer vision techniques.RESULTSHigh B cell densities were associated with protection from ESRD. In contrast, high densities of CD8+, γδ, and other CD4-CD8- T cells were associated with both acute renal failure and progression to ESRD. B cells were often organized into large periglomerular neighborhoods with Tfh cells, while CD4- T cells formed small neighborhoods in the tubulointerstitium, with frequency that predicted progression to ESRD.CONCLUSIONThese data reveal that specific in situ inflammatory states are associated with refractory and progressive renal disease.FUNDINGThis study was funded by the NIH Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence (AI082724), Department of Defense (LRI180083), Alliance for Lupus Research, and NIH awards (S10-OD025081, S10-RR021039, and P30-CA14599).

AB  - Rationale and Objectives: Interstitial fibrosis, common to most chronic kidney diseases, can potentially affect the speckle patterns of kidney ultrasound (US). Here we use Radiomics features derived from US images to identify kidneys with chronic kidney disease.Materials and Methods: B-mode US without speckle reduction was performed on a cohort of CKD patients (n = 75) and healthy subjects (n = 27). Images of the patients with renal cysts, agenesis and calculi were excluded. After background subtraction, regions of interest were selected from each kidney. Four hundred and sixty-five Radiomics features including first and second-order gray level statistics were calculated on the selected regions. Second-order features were also calculated on wavelet transformed images. A random forest model was used to identify the most important features that can differentiate healthy and diseased kidneys. The ten most important features, based on the Gini index, were used to train a support vector machine. Synthetic minority oversampling technique was used to remove over fitting.Results: Wavelet transformed, Gray Level Run Length Matrix based Normalized Run Length Non-uniformity, WT (LH) (GRLN) was identified as the most significant feature in differentiating CKD and healthy kidneys (accuracy - 0.85, sensitivity - 1.0). The mean WT (LH) GRLN of healthy kidneys (0.40 ± 0.01) was significantly higher (p < 0.01) than that of the CKD kidneys (0.24 ± 0.01). According to the Gini Index, the differentiability of WT (LH) GRLN was highest when the long axis of the kidney was oriented perpendicular to the columns of the image matrix.Conclusion: Radiomics features based on wavelet transformation are sensitive to directionality of US speckle patters and can be successfully used to differentiate CKD and healthy US kidney images.

AB  - Simple Summary: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma is a type of kidney cancer which comprises the majority of all renal cell carcinomas. Many efforts have been made to identify biomarkers which could help healthcare professionals better treat this kind of cancer. With extensive public data available, we conducted a machine learning study to determine a gene signature that could indicate patient survival with high accuracy. Through the min-Redundancy and Max-Relevance algorithm we generated a signature of 13 genes highly correlated with patient outcomes. These findings reveal potential strategies for personalized medicine in the clinical practice. Patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) have poor survival outcomes, especially if it has metastasized. It is of paramount importance to identify biomarkers in genomic data that could help predict the aggressiveness of ccRCC and its resistance to drugs. Thus, we conducted a study with the aims of evaluating gene signatures and proposing a novel one with higher predictive power and generalization in comparison to the former signatures. Using ccRCC cohorts of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-KIRC) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC-RECA), we evaluated linear survival models of Cox regression with 14 signatures and six methods of feature selection, and performed functional analysis and differential gene expression approaches. In this study, we established a 13-gene signature (AR, AL353637.1, DPP6, FOXJ1, GNB3, HHLA2, IL4, LIMCH1, LINC01732, OTX1, SAA1, SEMA3G, ZIC2) whose expression levels are able to predict distinct outcomes of patients with ccRCC. Moreover, we performed a comparison between our signature and others from the literature. The best-performing gene signature was achieved using the ensemble method Min-Redundancy and Max-Relevance (mRMR). This signature comprises unique features in comparison to the others, such as generalization through different cohorts and being functionally enriched in significant pathways: Urothelial Carcinoma, Chronic Kidney disease, and Transitional cell carcinoma, Nephrolithiasis. From the 13 genes in our signature, eight are known to be correlated with ccRCC patient survival and four are immune-related. Our model showed a performance of 0.82 using the Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) Area Under Curve (AUC) metric and it generalized well between the cohorts. Our findings revealed two clusters of genes with high expression (SAA1, OTX1, ZIC2, LINC01732, GNB3 and IL4) and low expression (AL353637.1, AR, HHLA2, LIMCH1, SEMA3G, DPP6, and FOXJ1) which are both correlated with poor prognosis. This signature can potentially be used in clinical practice to support patient treatment care and follow-up.

AB  - Recognizing that race is a social and not a biological construct, healthcare professionals and the public have called for removal of race in clinical algorithms. In response, the National Kidney Foundation and the American Society of Nephrology created the Task Force on Reassessing the Inclusion of Race in Diagnosing Kidney Diseases to examine the issue and provide recommendations. The final report from the Task Force recommends calculating estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) without a race coefficient using the recently published CKD-EPI 2021 creatinine (cr) and creatinine-cystatin C (cr-cys) equations. The Task Force recommends immediately replacing older eGFRcr equations (MDRD Study and CKD-EPI 2009) with the new CKD-EPI 2021 equation. In a 2019 survey by the College of American Pathologists, 23% of 6200 laboratories reporting eGFRcr used an incorrect equation that is not suitable for use with standardized creatinine measurements, 34% used the CKD-EPI 2009 equation and 43% used the MDRD Study 2006 equation re-expressed for standardized creatinine measurement. Rapid transition to using the CKD-EPI 2021 equation is an opportunity for laboratories to standardize to a single equation to eliminate differences in eGFRcr due to different equations used by different laboratories, and to report eGFR without use of race. We provide guidance to laboratories for implementing the CKD-EPI 2021 equations for both eGFRcr and eGFRcr-cys.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the risk factors for COVID-19 mortality among hospitalized patients in Jordan. All COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary hospital in Jordan from September 20, 2020, to August 8, 2021, were included in this study. Demographics, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, and laboratory results were extracted from the patients' electronic records. Multivariable logistic and machine learning (ML) methods were used to study variable importance. Out of 1,613 COVID-19 patients, 1,004 (62.2%) were discharged from the hospital (survived), while 609 (37.8%) died. Patients who were of elderly age (>65 years) (OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.28-3.16), current smokers (OR, 1.61; 95%CI, 1.17-2.23), and had severe or critical illness at admission ((OR, 1.56; 95%CI, 1.05-2.32) (OR, 2.94; 95%CI, 2.02-4.27); respectively), were at higher risk of mortality. Comorbidities including chronic kidney disease (OR, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.90-4.43), deep venous thrombosis (OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.08-6.35), malignancy (OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.46-3.38), diabetes (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.04-1.65), and heart failure (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.02-2.23) were significantly associated with increased risk of mortality. Laboratory abnormalities associated with mortality included hypernatremia (OR, 11.37; 95% CI, 4.33-29.81), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.42-2.31), hypoalbuminemia (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.37-2.25), and low platelets level (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05-1.95). Several demographic, clinical, and laboratory risk factors for COVID-19 mortality were identified. This study is the first to examine the risk factors associated with mortality using ML methods in the Middle East. This will contribute to a better understanding of the impact of the disease and improve the outcome of the pandemic worldwide.

AB  - This article summarises the Joint British Diabetes Societies for Inpatient Care guidelines on the management of ketoacidosis; available at https://abcd.care/resource/management‐diabetic‐ketoacidosis‐dka‐adults. The document explicitly states that when a person aged 16–18 is under the care of the paediatric team, then the paediatric guideline should be used, and if they are cared for by an adult team, then this guideline should be used. The guideline takes into account new evidence on the use of the previous version of this document, particularly the high prevalence of hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia, and recommends that when the glucose concentration drops below 14 mmol/L, that de‐escalating the insulin infusion rate from 0.1 to 0.05 units/kg/h should be considered. Furthermore, a section has been added to address the recognition that use of sodium glucose co‐transporter 2 inhibitors is associated with an increased risk of euglycaemic ketoacidosis. The management of ketoacidosis in people with end‐stage renal failure or on dialysis is also mentioned. Finally, the algorithms to illustrate the guideline have been updated.

AB  - Background: Urinary stone disease is a widespread disease with tremendous impact on those affected and on societies around the globe. Nevertheless, clinical and health care research in this area seem to lag far behind cardiovascular diseases or cancer. This may be due to the lack of an immediate deadly threat from the disease and therefore less public and professional interest. However, the patients suffer from recurring, sometimes intense pain and often must be treated in hospital. Long-term morbidity includes doubled rates of chronic kidney disease and arterial hypertension after at least one stone-related event. Observational studies, more specifically, registries and other electronic data sets have been proposed as a means of filling critical gaps in evidence. We propose a nationwide digital and fully automated registry as part of the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) call for the "establishment of model registries".Methods: RECUR builds on the technical infrastructure of Germany's Medical Informatics Initiative. Local data integration centres (DIC) of participating medical universities will collect pseudonymized and harmonized data from respective hospital information systems. In addition to their clinical data, participants will provide patient reported outcomes using a mobile patient app. Scientific data exploration includes queries and analysis of federated data from DICs of eleven participating sites. All primary patient data will remain at the participating sites at all times. With comprehensive data from this longitudinal registry, we will be able to describe the disease burden, to determine and validate risk factors, and to evaluate treatments. Implementation and operation of the RECUR registry will be funded by the BMBF for five years. Subsequently, the registry is to be continued by the German Society of Urology without significant costs for study personnel.Discussion: The proposed registry will substantially improve the structural and procedural framework for patients with recurrent urolithiasis. This includes advanced diagnostic algorithms and treatment pathways. The registry will help us identify those patients who will most benefit from specific interventions to prevent recurrences. The RECUR study protocol and the registry's technical architecture including full digitalization and automation of almost all registry-associated proceedings can be transferred to future registries.Trial Registration: This study is registered at the German Clinical Trial Register (Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien), DRKS-ID DRKS00026923 , date of registration January, 11th 2022.

AB  - Background: The use of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is steadily increasing with TAVR procedures offered to patients across the entire spectrum of surgical risks. The Gulf TAVR registry captures the demographics of patients undergoing TAVR in the Gulf region, comorbidities that drive outcomes, procedural success, complications, and one-year outcomes of death or rehospitalization.Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study for adult patients aged at least 18 years undergoing TAVR at eight centers in the Gulf region. The primary outcome was a composite of death or re-hospitalization at one-year. Secondary outcomes included the individual components of the composite, stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI). We used multivariable Cox regression to determine factors associated with the composite endpoint.Results: A total of 795 patients (56% male) were included in the final analysis with a mean age of 74.6 (standard deviation (SD) 8.9) years, Society of Thoracic Surgeons Score (STS) Score 4.9 (4.2), ejection fraction of 53% (12.7%). Transfemoral approach was employed in over 95% (762/795). The primary outcomes rate was 12.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.6-15.4); secondary endpoints were death 5.4% (95% CI 4.0-7.2); stroke 0.8% (95% CI 0.3, 1.7), MI 0.8% (95% CI 0.4-1.9), rehospitalization: 9.3% (95% CI 7.5-11.5) of whom 71.6% were related to cardiovascular causes. 77% of the cardiovascular admissions were attributable to heart failure or the need for pacemaker implantation. Stage IV or V chronic kidney disease was significantly associated with the primary composite endpoint (Hazard Ratio: 2.49, [95% CI: 1.31, 4.73], p = 0.005). Although not significant, paravalvular leak and severe left ventricular dysfunction showed a 2-fold and 3-fold increased risk for the composite endpoint, respectively.Conclusions: The Gulf TAVR registry is the first of its kind in the region. It profiles an elderly population with a high procedural success rate and a low rate of complications. One-year outcomes were primarily driven by repeat hospitalization for heart failure and pacemaker implantation indicating a need to optimize heart failure management and improve algorithms for the detection of conduction abnormalities.

AB  - Background: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), i.e., gradual decrease in the renal function spanning over a duration of several months to years without any major symptoms, is a life-threatening disease. It progresses in six stages according to the severity level. It is categorized into various stages based on the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), which in turn utilizes several attributes, like age, sex, race and Serum Creatinine. Among multiple available models for estimating GFR value, Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI), which is a linear model, has been found to be quite efficient because it allows detecting all CKD stages.Methods: Early detection and cure of CKD is extremely desirable as it can lead to the prevention of unwanted consequences. Machine learning methods are being extensively advocated for early detection of symptoms and diagnosis of several diseases recently. With the same motivation, the aim of this study is to predict the various stages of CKD using machine learning classification algorithms on the dataset obtained from the medical records of affected people. Specifically, we have used the Random Forest and J48 algorithms to obtain a sustainable and practicable model to detect various stages of CKD with comprehensive medical accuracy.Results: Comparative analysis of the results revealed that J48 predicted CKD in all stages better than random forest with an accuracy of 85.5%. The study also showed that J48 shows improved performance over Random Forest.Conclusions: The study concluded that it may be used to build an automated system for the detection of severity of CKD.

AB  - Background: It is unclear whether data-driven machine learning models, which are trained on large epidemiological cohorts, may improve prediction of comorbidities in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).Methods: In this proof-of-concept study, we included people living with HIV in the prospective Swiss HIV Cohort Study with a first estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >60 mL/minute/1.73 m2 after 1 January 2002. Our primary outcome was chronic kidney disease (CKD)-defined as confirmed decrease in eGFR ≤60 mL/minute/1.73 m2 over 3 months apart. We split the cohort data into a training set (80%), validation set (10%), and test set (10%), stratified for CKD status and follow-up length.Results: Of 12 761 eligible individuals (median baseline eGFR, 103 mL/minute/1.73 m2), 1192 (9%) developed a CKD after a median of 8 years. We used 64 static and 502 time-changing variables: Across prediction horizons and algorithms and in contrast to expert-based standard models, most machine learning models achieved state-of-the-art predictive performances with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve and precision recall curve ranging from 0.926 to 0.996 and from 0.631 to 0.956, respectively.Conclusions: In people living with HIV, we observed state-of-the-art performances in forecasting individual CKD onsets with different machine learning algorithms.

AB  - Extensive chronic tinea corporis (EC-TC) is common in people living in tropical environments and in individuals living with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, adults with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) who seek kidney transplant (KTx) wait-listing require an infection-free medical clearance. Australian clinical care guidelines suggest tinea corporis is cured by antifungal treatment within 2 weeks in the general population, but there are no specific treatment guidelines for adults with severely reduced kidney function who require haemodialysis. Aim To describe factors contributing to delayed KTx wait-listing in a patient with EC-TC. Method: We undertook a case review to address both treatment response for EC-TC for a 43-year-old female with a history of diabetic nephropathy following haemodialysis initiation, and the time it took for her to achieve KTx wait-listing. Follow-up interviews with the client and supporting clinicians were completed in order to learn more about individual perspectives of care. Results We observed cure of EC-TC on day 394, and achievement of KTx wait-listing on day 496. The treatment algorithm used to achieve cure involved extended courses of oral terbinafine (250 mg post-dialysis three times weekly, partial response) and oral fluconazole (cure within 3 weeks; 100 mg weekly at dialysis). Holistic care during KTx workup was valued by the patient. Conclusion Delayed cure of EC-TC contributed to delayed KTx wait-listing. The in-depth interviews therefore identified healthcare innovations to assist systematic identification and treatment initiation for EC-TC. Furthermore, specific research to improve the treatment response is recommended.

AB  - Background: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly prescribed for pain and inflammation. NSAID complications include acute kidney injury (AKI), causing burden to patients and health services through increased morbidity, mortality, and hospital admissions. Aim: To measure the extent of NSAID prescribing in an adult population, the degree to which patients with potential higher risk of AKI were exposed to NSAIDs, and to quantify their risk of AKI. Design & setting: Retrospective 2-year closed-cohort study. Method: A retrospective cohort of adults was identified from a pseudonymised electronic primary care database in Hampshire, UK. The cohort had clinical information, prescribing data, and complete GP- and hospital-ordered biochemistry data. NSAID exposure (minimum one prescription in a 2-month period) was categorised as never, intermittent, and continuous, and first AKI using the national AKI e-alert algorithm. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used to explore NSAID prescribing patterns and AKI risk. Results: The baseline population was 702 265. NSAID prescription fell from 19 364 (2.8%) to 16 251 (2.4%) over 2 years. NSAID prescribing was positively associated with older age, female sex, greater socioeconomic deprivation, and certain comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis) and negatively with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and heart failure. Among those prescribed NSAIDs, AKI was associated with older age, greater deprivation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), CVD, heart failure, diabetes, and hypertension. Conclusion: Despite generally good prescribing practice, NSAID prescribing was identified in some people at higher risk of AKI (for example, patients with CKD and older) for whom medication review and NSAID deprescribing should be considered.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease is characterized by the development of renal fibrosis. The basic mechanisms of renal fibrosis have not yet been fully investigated despite significant progress in understanding the etiology of the disease. In this work, the researchers sought to identify potential diagnostic indicators for renal fibrosis. From the GEO database, we were able to acquire two gene expression profiles with publically available data (GSE22459 and GSE76882, respectively) from human renal fibrosis and control samples. 215 renal fibrosis specimens and 124 normal specimens were examined for differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The SVM-RFE and LASSO regression models were used to discover potential markers. CIBERSORT was applied to estimate the combined cohorts' immune cell fraction compositional trends in renal fibrosis. RT-PCR was used to examine the expression of ISG20 in renal fibrosis and healthy samples. In vitro experiments were applied to examine the function of ISG20 knockdown on the progression of renal fibrosis. In this study, we identified 24 DEGs. The result of LASSO and SVM-RFE identified nine critical genes. ROC assays confirmed the diagnostic value of the above nine genes for renal fibrosis. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed that ISG20 and SERPINA3 were both found to be correlated with T cell follicular helper, neutrophils, T cell CD4 memory activated, eosinophils, T cell CD8, dendritic cell activated, B cell memory, monocytes, macrophage M2, plasma cells, T cell CD4 naïve, mast cell resting, B cell naïve, T cell regulatory, and NK cell activated. Finally, we observed that the expression of ISG20 and SERPINA3 was distinctly increased in renal fibrosis samples compared with normal samples. ISG20 siRNA significantly suppressed the progression of renal fibrosis in vitro. Overall, this study identified nine diagnostic biomarkers for renal fibrosis. ISG20 may be a novel therapeutic target of renal fibrosis.

AB  - Objective: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is evaluated based on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using a gamma camera in the nuclear medicine center or hospital in a routine procedure, but the gamma camera does not provide the accurate stages of the diseases. Therefore, this research aimed to find out the normal or abnormal stages of CKD based on the value of GFR using an artificial neural network (ANN).Methods: Two hundred fifty (Training 188, Testing 62) kidney patients who underwent the ultrasonography test to diagnose the renal test in our nuclear medical centre were scanned using gamma camera. The patients were injected with 99mTc-DTPA before the scanning procedure. After pushing the syringe into the patient's vein, the pre-syringe and post syringe radioactive counts were calculated using the gamma camera. The artificial neural network uses the softmax function with cross-entropy loss to diagnose CKD normal or abnormal labels depending on the value of GFR in the output layer.Results: The results showed that the accuracy of the proposed ANN model was 99.20% for K-fold cross-validation. The sensitivity and specificity were 99.10% and 99.20%, respectively. The Area under the curve (AUC) was 0.9994.Conclusion: The proposed model using an artificial neural network can classify the normal or abnormal stages of CKD. After implementing the proposed model clinically, it may upgrade the gamma camera to diagnose the normal or abnormal stages of the CKD with an appropriate GFR value.

AB  - The scores of the cognitive function of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are highly subjective, which tend to affect the results of clinical diagnosis. To overcome this issue, we proposed a novel model to explore the relationship between functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and clinical scores, thereby predicting cognitive function scores of patients with ESRD. The model incorporated three parts, namely, graph theoretic algorithm (GTA), whale optimization algorithm (WOA), and least squares support vector regression machine (LSSVRM). It was called GTA-WOA-LSSVRM or GWLS for short. GTA was adopted to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) of topological parameters, which were extracted as the features from the functional networks of the brain. Then, the statistical method and Pearson correlation analysis were used to select the features. Finally, the LSSVRM was built according to the selected features to predict the cognitive function scores of patients with ESRD. Besides, WOA was introduced to optimize the parameters in the LSSVRM kernel function to improve the prediction accuracy. The results validated that the prediction accuracy obtained by GTA-WOA-LSSVRM was higher than several comparable models, such as GTA-SVRM, GTA-LSSVRM, and GTA-WOA-SVRM. In particular, the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the predicted scores and the actual scores of patients with ESRD were 0.92, 0.88, and 4.14%, respectively. The proposed method can more accurately predict the cognitive function scores of ESRD patients and thus helps to understand the pathophysiological mechanism of cognitive dysfunction associated with ESRD.

AB  - Background: To develop a pediatric-specific hypertension algorithm using administrative data and use it to evaluate the association between acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care unit (ICU) and hypertension diagnosis 5 years post-discharge. Methods: Two-center retrospective cohort study of children (≤ 18 years old) admitted to the pediatric ICU in Montreal, Canada, between 2003 and 2005 and followed until 2010. Patients with a valid healthcare number and without end-stage renal disease were included. Patients who could not be merged with the provincial database, did not survive admission, underwent cardiac surgery, had pre-existing renal disease associated with hypertension or a prior diagnosis of hypertension were excluded. AKI defined using the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition. Using diagnostic codes and medications from administrative data, novel pediatric-specific hypertension definitions were designed. Both the evaluation of the prevalence of hypertension diagnosis and the association between AKI and hypertension occurred. Results: Nineteen hundred and seventy eight patients were included (median age at admission [interquartile range] 4.3 years [1.1–11.8], 44% female, 325 (16.4%) developed AKI). Of these patients, 130 (7%) had a hypertension diagnosis 5 years after discharge. Patients with AKI had a higher prevalence of hypertension diagnosis [non-AKI: 84/1653 (5.1%) vs. AKI: 46/325 (14.2%), p <.001]. Children with AKI had a higher adjusted risk of hypertension diagnosis (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] 2.19 [1.47–3.26]). Conclusions: Children admitted to the ICU have a high prevalence of hypertension post-discharge and children with AKI have over two times higher risk of hypertension compared to those with no AKI.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has attracted considerable attention in the public health domain in recent years. Researchers have exerted considerable effort in attempting to identify critical factors that may affect the deterioration of CKD. In clinical practice, the physical conditions of CKD patients are regularly recorded. The data of CKD patients are recorded as a high-dimensional time-series. Therefore, how to analyze these time-series data for identifying the factors affecting CKD deterioration becomes an interesting topic. This study aims at developing prediction models for stage 4 CKD patients to determine whether their eGFR level decreased to less than 15 ml/min/1.73m (end-stage renal disease, ESRD) 6 months after collecting their final laboratory test information by evaluating time-related features. A total of 463 CKD patients collected from January 2004 to December 2013 at one of the biggest dialysis centers in southern Taiwan were included in the experimental evaluation. We integrated the temporal abstraction (TA) technique with data mining methods to develop CKD progression prediction models. Specifically, the TA technique was used to extract vital features (TA-related features) from high-dimensional time-series data, after which several data mining techniques, including C4.5, classification and regression tree (CART), support vector machine, and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), were applied to develop CKD progression prediction models. The results revealed that incorporating temporal information into the prediction models increased the efficiency of the models. The AdaBoost+CART model exhibited the most accurate prediction among the constructed models (Accuracy: 0.662, Sensitivity: 0.620, Specificity: 0.704, and AUC: 0.715). A number of TA-related features were found to be associated with the deterioration of renal function. These features can provide further clinical information to explain the progression of CKD. TA-related features extracted by long-term tracking of changes in laboratory test values can enable early diagnosis of ESRD. The developed models using these features can facilitate medical personnel in making clinical decisions to provide appropriate diagnoses and improved care quality to patients with CKD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Priapism is a rare condition in children and the treatment algorithm is controversial in this age group. Herein, we report eight cases with low-flow priapism and our stepwise treatment approach in light of literature. METHODS: We present a simple stepwise treatment for low-flow priapism including five steps. Step 1: Cold compress and analgesia while evaluation the priapism and its etiology. Step 2: Corporal aspiration and adrenaline infusion in the ward. Step 3: Modified Winter shunt in the same place. Step 4: Ketamine application and caudal block in the operating room. Step 5: Sapheno-cavernous (Grayhack) shunt. Eight cases with low-flow priapism were reviewed retrospectively. Symptoms, duration of tumescence, the interventions, and step that provide detumescence were recorded. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 8.5 years (1-17 y). The median time of the priapism before admission was 15 h (4-165 h). The etiological factors were sickle cell disease, hemodialysis due to chronic renal failure, and factor V Leiden mutation in three patients. Detumescence was achieved in one patient at Step 2, in two patients at Steps 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Rigidity of cavernous body was observed in one patient in long-term follow-up. CONCLUSION: Low-flow priapism is a urological emergency that may cause erectile dysfunction. Treatment options should be selected according to a protocol that prevents time loss and avoids more invasive treatment in unnecessary situations. Our algorithm with simple nature and its steps from less invasive to more invasive procedures may be an alternative for the treatment of low-flow priapism.
AB  - AMAÇ: Priapizm çocukluk çağında çok nadir görülen bir hastalıktır. Hasta sayısının azlığı nedeniyle tedavi algoritması da halen literatürde netleşmemiştir. Bu çalışmada, priapizmli sekiz çocuk hasta ve kliniğimizde uyguladığımız basamaklı tedavi yaklaşımımız literatür ışığında sunulmaktadır. GEREÇ VE YÖNTEM: Uyguladığımız tedavi beş basamaktan oluşmaktadır: 1. basamak; etiyoloji değerlendirmesi yapılırken soğuk kompres ve analjezi uygulaması. 2. basamak; korpus kavernozuma korporal aspirasyon ve adrenalin infüzyonu. 3. basamak; Modifiye Winter şunt. 4. basamak; ameliyathanede ketamin infüzyonu ve kaudal blok uygulaması. 5. basamak; safeno-kavernöz (Grayhack) şunt. Düşük akımlı priapizmi olan sekiz hastanın verileri geriye dönük olarak ele alındı. Başvuru şekli, tumesans süresi, yaşı, yapılan müdahaleler ve hangi basamakta detumesans sağlandığı kaydedildi. BULGULAR: Yaş ortalaması 8.5 (1-17) yıl idi. Başvuru öncesindeki ortanca tumesans süresi 15 saat (4-165) idi. Üç hastada etiyolojik faktörler; orak hücreli anemi, kronik böbrek yetersizliği nedeniyle yapılan hemodiyaliz ve faktör V Leiden mutasyonu idi. Bir hastada ikinci basamakta detumesans sağlandı. 3, 4, 5. basamakalarda detumesans sağlanan 2'şer hasta oldu. Uzun dönem kontrolünde bir hastada kavernöz cisim rijiditesi görüldü. TARTIŞMA: Düşük akımlı priapizm ürolojik bir acildir ve erektil disfonksiyona neden olabilir. Tedavi seçenekleri, zaman kaybını ve gereksiz invaziv işlemleri engellemek için bir algoritma veya bir tedavi protokolü ile uygulanmalıdır. Kliniğimizde uygulanan tedavi protokolü basit ve daha az invaziv işlemden daha invaziv işleme doğru gitmektedir ve düşük akımlı priapizm tedavisinde iyi bir alternatif olabilir.

AB  - In this narrative review, we focus on the application of artificial intelligence in the clinical history of patients with glomerular disease, digital pathology in kidney biopsy, renal ultrasonography imaging, and prediction of chronic kidney disease (CKD). With the development of natural language processing, the clinical history of a patient can be used to identify a computable phenotype. In kidney pathology, digital imaging has adopted innovative deep learning algorithms (DLAs) that can improve the predictive capability of the examined lesions. However, at this time, these applications can only be used in research because there is no recognized validation to replace the conventional diagnostic applications. Kidney ultrasonography, used in the clinical examination of patients, provides information about the progression of kidney damage. Machine learning algorithms (MLAs) with promising results for the early detection of CKD have been proposed, but, still, they are not solid enough to be incorporated into the clinical practice. A few tools for glomerulonephritis, based on MLAs, are available in clinical practice. They can be downloaded on computers and cellular phones but can only be applied to uniracial cohorts of patients. To improve their performance, it is necessary to organize large consortia with multiracial cohorts. Finally, in many studies MLA development has been carried out using retrospective cohorts. The performance of the models might differ in retrospective cohorts compared to real-world data. Therefore, the models should be validated in prospective external large cohorts.

AB  - Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serve and harmful syndrome in the intensive care unit. Comparing to the patients with AKI stage 1/2, the patients with AKI stage 3 have higher in-hospital mortality and risk of progression to chronic kidney disease. The purpose of this study is to develop a prediction model that predict whether patients with AKI stage 1/2 will progress to AKI stage 3.Methods: Patients with AKI stage 1/2, when they were first diagnosed with AKI in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, were included. We used the Logistic regression and machine learning extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) to build two models which can predict patients who will progress to AKI stage 3. Established models were evaluated by cross-validation, receiver operating characteristic curve, and precision-recall curves.Results: We included 25,711 patients, of whom 2130 (8.3%) progressed to AKI stage 3. Creatinine, multiple organ failure syndromes were the most important in AKI progression prediction. The XGBoost model has a better performance than the Logistic regression model on predicting AKI stage 3 progression. Thus, we build a software based on our data which can predict AKI progression in real time.Conclusions: The XGboost model can better identify patients with AKI progression than Logistic regression model. Machine learning techniques may improve predictive modeling in medical research.

AB  - Background: To identify the outcome-associated predictors and develop predictive models for patients receiving targeted temperature management (TTM) by artificial neural network (ANN).Methods: The derived cohort consisted of 580 patients with cardiac arrest and ROSC treated with TTM between January 2014 and August 2019. We evaluated the predictive value of parameters associated with survival and favorable neurologic outcome. ANN were applied for developing outcome prediction models. The generalizability of the models was assessed through 5-fold cross-validation. The performance of the models was assessed according to the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).Results: The parameters associated with survival were age, duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, history of diabetes mellitus (DM), heart failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP, body temperature, motor response after ROSC, emergent coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and the cooling methods. The parameters associated with the favorable neurologic outcomes were age, sex, DM, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ESRD, stroke, pre-arrest cerebral-performance category, BP, body temperature, motor response after ROSC, emergent coronary angiography or PCI, and cooling methods. After adequate training, ANN Model 1 to predict survival achieved an AUC of 0.80. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 75.9%, 71.6%, and 79.3%, respectively. ANN Model 4 to predict the favorable neurologic outcome achieved an AUC of 0.87, with accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 86.7%, 77.7%, and 88.0%, respectively.Conclusion: The ANN-based models achieved good performance to predict the survival and favorable neurologic outcomes after TTM. The models proposed have clinical value to assist in decision-making.

AB  - We present an automated knowledge synthesis and discovery framework to analyze published literature to identify and represent underlying mechanistic associations that aggravate chronic conditions due to COVID-19. Our literature-based discovery approach integrates text mining, knowledge graphs and medical ontologies to discover hidden and previously unknown pathophysiologic relations, dispersed across multiple public literature databases, between COVID-19 and chronic disease mechanisms. We applied our approach to discover mechanistic associations between COVID-19 and chronic conditions--i.e. diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease--to understand the long-term impact of COVID-19 on patients with chronic diseases. We found several gene-disease associations that could help identify mechanisms driving poor outcomes for COVID-19 patients with underlying conditions.

AB  - Background: Transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR) utilization has increased significantly in the United States over the last years. Yet, a risk-prediction tool for adverse events has not been developed. We aimed to generate a machine-learning-based algorithm to predict in-hospital mortality after TMVR.Methods: Patients who underwent TMVR from 2012 through 2015 were identified using the National Inpatient Sample database. The study population was randomly divided into a training set (n = 636) and a testing set (n = 213). Prediction models for in-hospital mortality were obtained using five supervised machine-learning classifiers.Results: A total of 849 TMVRs were analyzed in our study. The overall in-hospital mortality was 3.1%. A naïve Bayes (NB) model had the best discrimination for fifteen variables, with an area under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.80-0.87), compared to 0.77 for logistic regression (95% CI, 0.58-0.95), 0.73 for an artificial neural network (95% CI, 0.55-0.91), and 0.67 for both a random forest and a support-vector machine (95% CI, 0.47-0.87). History of coronary artery disease, of chronic kidney disease, and smoking were the three most significant predictors of in-hospital mortality.Conclusions: We developed a robust machine-learning-derived model to predict in-hospital mortality in patients undergoing TMVR. This model is promising for decision-making and deserves further clinical validation.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease are frequently inter‐connected and this association leads to an exponential growth of cardiovascular risk. This risk is currently underestimated by the existing algorithms and there is a constant need for new markers to predict adverse outcomes in this special population. In general population left atrial strain has emerged as an important tool for both the diagnosis and prognostic stratification, but data regarding its role in chronic kidney disease patients is scarce. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current evidence regarding this matter. Left atrial size and function mirror the duration and severity of increased left ventricular filling pressures. Increased left atrial volume index and impaired left atrial strain parameters are independent predictors for adverse cardiovascular events. Left atrial strain is impaired before changes in volume appear, thus being able to predict both diastolic and systolic function in chronic kidney disease patients. Finally, left atrial strain can identify renal patients with impaired exercise capacity and this could have clinical applications in the rehabilitation of this patients.

AB  - Lupus nephritis (LN) is common in people with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and advances, almost invariably, to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In this issue of the JCI, Abraham, Durkee, et al. presented a large-scale immune cell landscape of kidney biopsies from patients with LN by combining multiplexed confocal microscopy imaging with customized computer vision and quantification. The presence of diverse CD4- T cells in small neighborhoods, but not of B cells or CD4+ T cells in large neighborhoods, is linked to the development of ESRD. Unexpectedly, B cells in the kidney heralded a good prognosis. The precise location of different types of immune cells allows inference on possible interactions between different immune cells and also between immune and kidney-resident cells. The data have important implications on the development of prognostic tools and effective targeted therapies in patients with LN.

AB  - Background: Individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypertension (HTN), or diabetes mellitus (DM) are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The extent to which psychosocial factors are associated with increased CVD risk within these individuals is unclear. Black individuals experience a high degree of psychosocial stressors due to socioeconomic factors, environment, racism, and discrimination. We examined the association between psychosocial factors and risk of CVD events among Black men and women with CKD and CKD risk factors in the Jackson Heart Study.Methods and Results: We identified 1919 participants with prevalent CKD or CKD risk factors at baseline. We used rotated principal component analysis - a form of unsupervised machine learning that may identify constructs not intuitively identified by a person - to describe five groups of psychosocial components (including negative moods, religiosity, discrimination, negative outlooks, and negative coping resources) based on a battery of questionnaires. Multiple imputation by chained equation (MICE) was used to impute missing covariate data. Cox models were used to quantify the association between psychosocial components and incident CVD, defined as a fatal coronary heart disease event, myocardial infarction, cardiac procedure (angiography or revascularization procedure), or stroke. Of the 929 participants in the analysis, 67% were female, 28% were current/former smokers with mean age of 56 years and mean BMI of 33 kg/m2. Over a median follow-up of 8 years, 6% had an incident CVD event. In multivariable models, each standard deviation (SD) increase in the religiosity component was associated with an increased hazard for CVD event (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.09-2.13).Conclusions: Religiosity was associated with CVD among participants with prevalent CKD or CKD risk factors. Studies to better understand the mechanisms of this relationship are needed.

AB  - Background: Greater variability in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is associated with higher mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Heart failure (HF) is common in CKD and may increase variability through changes in hemodynamic and volume regulation. We sought to determine if patients with vs without HF have higher kidney function variability in CKD, and to define the association with mortality.Methods and Results: Patients undergoing coronary angiography from 2003 to 2013 with an eGFR of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were evaluated from the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Disease. Variability in the eGFR, measured as the coefficient of variation (CV) of residuals from the regression of eGFR vs time, was calculated spanning 3 months to 2 years after catheterization. Mortality was assessed 2 to 7 years after catheterization. Patients were grouped into 3 HF phenotypes: HF with reduced ejection fraction, HF with preserved ejection, and no HF. Regression was used to evaluate associations between HF phenotypes and variability in the eGFR and between variability in the eGFR and mortality rate with stratification by HF phenotype. Among 3767 participants, the median eGFR at baseline was 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (interquartile range 33-53 mL/min/1.73 m2), and longitudinal measures of eGFR over 21 months had within-patient residual variability (CV) of 14% (9%-20%). In adjusted analyses, variability in the eGFR was greater in those with HF with preserved ejection (n = 695, CV difference 0.98%, 95% confidence interval 0.14%-1.81%) or HF with reduced ejection fraction (n = 800, CV difference 2.51%, 95% confidence interval 1.66%-3.37%) relative to no HF (n = 2272). In 3068 participants eligible for mortality analysis, the presence of HF and greater variability in the eGFR were each associated independently with higher mortality, but there was no evidence of interaction between variability in the eGFR and any HF phenotype (all P for interaction ≥.49).Conclusions: Variability in the eGFR is greater in patients with HF and associated with mortality. Prediction algorithms and classification schemes should consider not only static, but also dynamic eGFR variability in HF and CKD prognostication.

AB  - Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), a nonatherosclerotic, noninflammatory disease of medium-sized arteries, is an underdiagnosed disease. We investigated the urinary proteome and developed a classifier for discrimination of FMD from healthy controls and other diseases. We further hypothesized that urinary proteomics biomarkers may be associated with alterations in medium-sized, but not large artery geometry and mechanics. The study included 33 patients with mostly multifocal, renal FMD who underwent in depth arterial exploration using ultra-high frequency ultrasound. The cohort was separated in a training set of 23 patients with FMD from Belgium and an independent test set of 10 patients with FMD from Italy. For each set, controls matched 2:1 were selected from the Human Urinary Proteome Database. The specificity of the classifier was tested in 700 additional controls from general population studies, patients with chronic kidney disease (n=66) and coronary artery disease (n=31). Three hundred thirty-five urinary peptides, mostly related to collagen turnover, were identified in the training cohort and combined into a classifier. When applying in the test cohort, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 1.00, 100% specificity at 100% sensitivity. The classifier maintained a high specificity in additional controls (98.3%), patients with chronic kidney (90.9%) and coronary artery (96.8%) diseases. Furthermore, in patients with FMD, the proteomic score was positively associated with radial wall thickness and wall cross-sectional area. In conclusion, a proteomic score has the potential to discriminate between patients with FMD and controls. If confirmed in a wider and more diverse cohort, these findings may pave the way for a noninvasive diagnostic test of FMD.

AB  - Early and precise identification of individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2D) at risk for progressing to chronic kidney disease (CKD) is essential to prevent complications of diabetes. Here, we identify and evaluate prospective metabolite biomarkers and the best set of predictors of CKD in the longitudinal, population-based Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) cohort by targeted metabolomics and machine learning approaches. Out of 125 targeted metabolites, sphingomyelin C18:1 and phosphatidylcholine diacyl C38:0 were identified as candidate metabolite biomarkers of incident CKD specifically in hyperglycemic individuals followed during 6.5 years. Sets of predictors for incident CKD developed from 125 metabolites and 14 clinical variables showed highly stable performances in all three machine learning approaches and outperformed the currently established clinical algorithm for CKD. The two metabolites in combination with five clinical variables were identified as the best set of predictors, and their predictive performance yielded a mean area value under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.857. The inclusion of metabolite variables in the clinical prediction of future CKD may thus improve the risk prediction in people with prediabetes and T2D. The metabolite link with hyperglycemia-related early kidney dysfunction warrants further investigation.

AB  - Globally, there is increasing recognition that agricultural workers are at risk for chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKD u). Recurrent heat exposure, physical exertion, dehydration, muscle damage, and inflammation are hypothesized to contribute to the development of CKD u, but the relative importance of these processes and the interactions among them remain unclear. Moreover, there is a need to identify biomarkers that could distinguish individuals who are at greatest risk for kidney damage to target preventative interventions for CKD u. In this study, we evaluated dehydration and markers of inflammation, muscle damage, and renal function in agricultural workers at a non-workday baseline assessment. Urine specific gravity and kidney function were measured before and after work shifts on three subsequent days, and heat index, core body temperature, and heart rate were monitored during the work shifts. A combination of direct comparisons and machine learning algorithms revealed that reduced levels of uromodulin and sodium in urine and increased levels of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein in serum were indicative of dehydration at baseline, and that dehydration, high body mass index, reduced urine uromodulin, and increased serum interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein at baseline were predictive of acute kidney injury on subsequent workdays. Our findings suggest a method for identifying agricultural workers at greatest risk for kidney injury and reveal potential mechanisms responsible for this process, including pathways overlapping in dehydration and kidney injury. These results will guide future studies confirming these mechanisms and introducing interventions to protect kidney health in this vulnerable population.

AB  - Racial and social unrest witnessed during 2020 ignited a national conversation about the appropriateness of the use of race in health care algorithms and in the estimation of kidney function in particular. The growing concerns over the use of race in kidney function–estimating equations prompted the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) and American Society of Nephrology to launch an effort for change by establishing a task force on reassessing the use of race in diagnosing kidney disease. After nearly a year examining the evidence and obtaining testimony from experts and stakeholders, the task force recommended the immediate implementation of the 2020 Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology creatinine equation refit without race in all US laboratories; increased routine use of cystatin C for confirmation of estimated glomerular filtration rate in clinical decision-making and a call for research on glomerular filtration rate estimation with new endogenous filtration markers and on addressing disparities in health and health care. The NKF and American Society of Nephrology strongly encouraged rapid adoption of these new recommendations.

AB  - Background Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can cause severe illness and death. Predictors of poor outcome collected on hospital admission may inform clinical and public health decisions. Methods We conducted a retrospective observational cohort investigation of 297 adults admitted to 8 academic and community hospitals in Georgia, United States, during March 2020. Using standardized medical record abstraction, we collected data on predictors including admission demographics, underlying medical conditions, outpatient antihypertensive medications, recorded symptoms, vital signs, radiographic findings, and laboratory values. We used random forest models to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for predictors of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and death. Results Compared with age <45 years, ages 65–74 years and ≥75 years were predictors of IMV (aORs, 3.12 [95% CI, 1.47–6.60] and 2.79 [95% CI, 1.23–6.33], respectively) and the strongest predictors for death (aORs, 12.92 [95% CI, 3.26–51.25] and 18.06 [95% CI, 4.43–73.63], respectively). Comorbidities associated with death (aORs, 2.4–3.8; P  < .05) included end-stage renal disease, coronary artery disease, and neurologic disorders, but not pulmonary disease, immunocompromise, or hypertension. Prehospital use vs nonuse of angiotensin receptor blockers (aOR, 2.02 [95% CI, 1.03–3.96]) and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (aOR, 1.91 [95% CI, 1.03–3.55]) were associated with death. Conclusions After adjustment for patient and clinical characteristics, older age was the strongest predictor of death, exceeding comorbidities, abnormal vital signs, and laboratory test abnormalities. That coronary artery disease, but not chronic lung disease, was associated with death among hospitalized patients warrants further investigation, as do associations between certain antihypertensive medications and death.

AB  - Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) causes a significant health burden in Australia, and up to 50% of Australians with CKD remain undiagnosed. Aims: To estimate the 5‐year risk for CKD from general practice (GP) clinical records and to investigate the spatial variation and hot spots of CKD risk in an Australian community. Method: A cross‐sectional study was designed using de‐identified GP clinical data recorded from 2010 to 2015. A total of 16 GP participated in this study from West Adelaide, Australia. We used health records of 36 565 patients aged 35–74 years, with no prior history of CKD. The 5‐year estimated CKD risk was calculated using the QKidney algorithm. Individuals' risk score was aggregated to Statistical Area Level 1 to predict the community CKD risk. A spatial hotspot analysis was applied to identify the communities with greater risk. Results: The mean estimated 5‐year risk for CKD in the sample population was 0.95% (0.93–0.97). Overall, 2.4% of the study population was at high risk of CKD. Significant hot spots and cold spots of CKD risk were identified within the study region. Hot spots were associated with lower socioeconomic status. Conclusions: This study demonstrated a new approach to explore the spatial variation of CKD risk at a community level, and implementation of a risk prediction model into a clinical setting may aid in early detection and increase disease awareness in regions of unmet CKD care.

AB  - Renal fibrosis is thought to be the final common pathway leading to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal failure. Except for renal replacement therapy, no adequate treatment regimen is available; therefore studies on the treatment of renal fibrosis have attracted significant interest. In recent years, studies have shown that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) may represent an attractive source to produce drugs with antifibrosis effects. The aim of this study was to establish a robust cell-based high-content screening (HCS) approach to identify TCM compounds with antifibrosis effects in NRK49F cells following TGF-β1 exposure. When designing the model, one of the most important steps involved the stability and reproducibility of this cell-based model. Therefore, we initially optimized the experimental parameters. Then, our HCS model was validated using SB525334, an inhibitor of the TGF-β1 receptor, and curcumin and emodin, two TCM compounds with well-documented anti-renal fibrosis activity. Subsequently, the proven reliable HCS model was used to screen a standard TCM compound library, which included 344 TCM molecules. Based on our HCS algorithm, a total of 16 compounds were identified to have prospective inhibitory activity. These compounds were further validated by verification experiments. Strikingly, eight compounds have been shown to inhibit renal fibrosis; six of them had rarely been described in the literature, namely, Ligustrazine, Glycyrrhizic acid, Astragaloside iv, Hydroxysafflor Yellow A, Crocin, and Gypenosides. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which a HCS assay was performed to identify TCM compounds with anti-renal fibrosis effects. The HCS approach was successfully applied to screen active compounds and will be propitious to further anti-renal fibrosis drugs discovery research. Meanwhile, it may offer possibilities for identifying lead compounds for treating other diseases from registered Chinese herbal medicines.

AB  - Background: Vascular calcification is an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease. Computed tomography (CT) is the gold-standard for detecting vascular calcification. Radial volumetric-interpolated breath-hold examination (radial-VIBE), a free-breathing gradient-echo cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) sequence, has advantages over CT as it is ionising radiation-free. However, its capability in detecting thoracic aortic calcification (TAC) has not been investigated. This study aims to compare radial-VIBE to CT for the detection of TAC in the descending aorta of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) using semi-automated methods, and to investigate the association between TAC and coronary artery calcification (CAC). Methods: Paired cardiac CT and radial-VIBE CMR scans from ESRD patients participating in 2 prospective studies were obtained. Calcification volume was quantified using semi-automated methods in a 9 cm segment of the thoracic aorta. Correlation and agreement between TAC volume measured on CMR and CT were assessed with Spearman's correlation coefficient (ρ), linear regression, Bland–Altman plots and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Association between CAC Agatston score and TAC volume determined by CT and CMR was measured with Spearman's correlation coefficient. Results: Scans from 96 participants were analysed. Positive correlation was found between CMR and CT calcification volume [ρ = 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45–0.73]. ICC for consistency was 0.537 (95% CI 0.378–0.665). Bland–Altman plot revealed that compared to CT, CMR volumes were systematically higher at low calcification volume, and lower at high calcification volume. CT did not detect calcification in 41.7% of participants, while radial-VIBE CMR detected signal which the semi-quantitative algorithm reported as calcification in all of those individuals. Instances of suboptimal radial-VIBE CMR image quality were deemed to be the major contributors to the discrepancy. Correlations between CAC Agatston score and TAC volume measured by CT and CMR were ρ = 0.404 (95% CI 0.214–0.565) and ρ = 0.211 (95% CI 0.008–0.396), respectively. Conclusion: Radial-VIBE CMR can detect TAC with strong positive association to CT, albeit with the presence of proportional bias. Quantification of vascular calcification by radial-VIBE remains a promising area for future research, but improvements in image quality are necessary.

AB  - Objective: Changes in protein glycosylation are a hallmark of immune‐mediated diseases. Glycans are master regulators of the inflammatory response and are important molecules in self–nonself discrimination. This study was undertaken to investigate whether lupus nephritis (LN) exhibits altered cellular glycosylation to identify a unique glycosignature that characterizes LN pathogenesis. Methods: A comprehensive tissue glycomics characterization was performed in kidney specimens from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and biopsy‐proven LN. A combination of advanced tissue mass spectrometry, in situ glyco‐characterization, and ex vivo glycophenotyping was performed to structurally map the repertoire of N‐glycans in LN tissue samples. Results: LN exhibited a unique glycan signature characterized by increased abundance and spatial distribution of unusual mannose‐enriched glycans that are typically found in lower microorganisms. This glycosignature was specific for LN, as it was not observed in other kidney diseases. Exposure of mannosylated glycans in LN was shown to occur at the cell surface of kidney cells, promoting increased recognition by specific glycan‐recognizing receptors expressed by immune cells. This abnormal glycosignature of LN was shown to be due to a deficient complex N‐glycosylation pathway and a proficient O‐mannosylation pathway. Moreover, mannosylation levels detected in kidney biopsy samples from patients with LN at the time of diagnosis were demonstrated to predict the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with 93% specificity. Conclusion: Cellular mannosylation is a marker of LN, predicting the development of CKD, and thus representing a potential glycobiomarker to be included in the diagnostic and prognostic algorithm of LN.

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has had a significant impact on our lives and plays many roles in various fields. By analyzing the past 30 years of AI trends in the field of nephrology, using a bibliography, we wanted to know the areas of interest and future direction of AI in research related to the kidney.Methods: Using the Institute for Scientific Information Web of Knowledge database, we searched for articles published from 1990 to 2019 in January 2020 using the keywords AI; deep learning; machine learning; and kidney (or renal). The selected articles were reviewed manually at the points of citation analysis.Results: From 218 related articles, we selected the top fifty with 1188 citations in total. The most-cited article was cited 84 times and the least-cited one was cited 12 times. These articles were published in 40 journals. Expert Systems with Applications (three articles) and Kidney International (three articles) were the most cited journals.

AB  - Changes in arterial structure and function are seen early in the course of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and have been causally associated with cardiovascular (CV) morbidity. Numerous potential injuries encompassing both traditional and uremia-specific CV risk factors can induce structural arterial changes and accelerate arterial stiffening. When the buffering capacity of the normally elastic arteries is reduced, damage to vulnerable microcirculatory beds can occur. Moreover, the resultant increase to cardiac afterload contributes to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac dysfunction. Adult studies have linked arterial stiffness with increased risk of mortality, CV events, cognitive decline, and CKD progression. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is currently the gold standard of arterial stiffness assessment but its measurement in children is challenging due to technical difficulties and physiologic aspects related to growth and poor standardization between algorithms for calculating PWV. Nevertheless, studies in pediatric CKD have reported increased arterial stiffness in children with advanced CKD, on dialysis, and after kidney transplantation. Development of arterial stiffness in children with CKD is closely related to mineral-bone disease and hypertension, but other factors may also play a significant role. The clinical relevance of accelerated arterial stiffness in childhood on cardiovascular outcomes in adult life remains unclear, and prospective studies are needed. In this review we discuss mechanisms leading to arterial stiffness in CKD and its clinical implications, along with issues surrounding the technical aspects of arterial stiffness assessment in children.

AB  - Background: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the major complication of diabetes mellitus, and leading cause of end-stage renal disease. The underlying molecular mechanism of DN is not yet completely clear. The aim of this study was to analyze a DN microarray dataset using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) algorithm for better understanding of DN pathogenesis and exploring key genes in the disease progression.Methods: The identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in DN dataset GSE47183 were introduced to WGCNA algorithm to construct co-expression modules. STRING database was used for construction of Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of the genes in all modules and the hub genes were identified considering both the degree centrality in the PPI networks and the ranked lists of weighted networks. Gene ontology and Reactome pathway enrichment analyses were performed on each module to understand their involvement in the biological processes and pathways. Following validation of the hub genes in another DN dataset (GSE96804), their up-stream regulators, including microRNAs and transcription factors were predicted and a regulatory network comprising of all these molecules was constructed.Results: After normalization and analysis of the dataset, 2475 significant DEGs were identified and clustered into six different co-expression modules by WGCNA algorithm. Then, DEGs of each module were subjected to functional enrichment analyses and PPI network constructions. Metabolic processes, cell cycle control, and apoptosis were among the top enriched terms. In the next step, 23 hub genes were identified among the modules in genes and five of them, including FN1, SLC2A2, FABP1, EHHADH and PIPOX were validated in another DN dataset. In the regulatory network, FN1 was the most affected hub gene and mir-27a and REAL were recognized as two main upstream-regulators of the hub genes.Conclusions: The identified hub genes from the hearts of co-expression modules could widen our understanding of the DN development and might be of targets of future investigations, exploring their therapeutic potentials for treatment of this complicated disease.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate the mediating effect of abnormal brain micro-structures on the relationship between clinical risk factors and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and further predict individual cognitive function in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis.Methods: In total, 40 ESRD patients and 30 healthy controls were prospectively enrolled in our study. All subjects completed diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) examinations and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) test. Between-group differences in the DKI metrics were analyzed. In addition, the mediating effects of altered brain micro-structures on the association between clinical risk factors and MCI were determined by mediation analysis. Finally, cognitive function was predicted based on DKI metrics and clinical characteristics by applying the optimized least squares support vector regression machine.Results: We observed disrupted brain micro-structures in ESRD patients with MCI, as indicated by significantly altered DKI parameters. Significant correlations were found between the DKI metrics, clinical characteristics, and MoCA scores. In ESRD patients, low hemoglobin level and high serum creatine level were clinical risk factors for MCI. A decreased axial kurtosis value in the left hippocampus may partially mediate the impact of serum creatine on MCI. Furthermore, the prediction model could predict cognitive scores associated with ESRD with relatively high accuracy.Conclusion: Aberrant micro-structures partially mediated the association between clinical risk factors and MCI, which is a novel insight into the progression of cognitive dysfunction in ESRD patients. Combined DKI metrics and clinical characteristics could be used as features to efficiently predict cognitive function associated with ESRD.

AB  - Aim. To analyze the serum metabolites in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) showing dampness syndrome and patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) showing dampness syndrome and to seek the substance that serves as the underlying basis of dampness syndrome in “same syndromes in different diseases.” Methods. Metabolic spectrum by GC-MS was performed using serum samples from 29 patients with CHD showing dampness syndrome and 32 patients with CRF showing dampness syndrome. The principal component analysis and statistical analysis of partial least squares were performed to detect the metabolites with different levels of expression in patients with CHD and CRF. Furthermore, by comparing the VIP value and data mining in METLIN and HMDB, we identified the common metabolites in both patient groups. Results. (1) Ten differential metabolites were found in patients with CHD showing dampness syndrome when compared to healthy subjects. Meanwhile, nine differential metabolites were found in patients with CRF showing dampness syndrome when compared to healthy subjects. (2) There were 9 differential metabolites identified when the serum metabolites of the CHD patients with dampness syndrome were compared to those of CRF patients with dampness syndrome. There were 4 common metabolites found in the serums of both patient groups.

AB  - Background: Pharmacy administrative claims data remain an accessible and efficient source to measure medication adherence for frequently hospitalized patient populations that are systematically excluded from the landmark drug trials. Published pharmacotherapy studies use medication possession ratio (MPR) and proportion of days covered (PDC) to calculate medication adherence and usually fail to incorporate hospitalization and prescription overlap/gap from claims data. To make the cacophony of adherence measures clearer, this study created a refined hospital-adjusted algorithm to capture pharmacotherapy adherence among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Methods: The United States Renal Data System (USRDS) registry of ESRD was used to determine prescription-filling patterns of those receiving new prescriptions for oral P2Y12 inhibitors (P2Y12-I) between 2011 and 2015. P2Y12-I-naïve patients were followed until death, kidney transplantation, discontinuing medications, or loss to follow-up. After flagging/censoring key variables, the algorithm adjusted for hospital length of stay (LOS) and medication overlap. Hospital-adjusted medication adherence (HA-PDC) was calculated and compared with traditional MPR and PDC methods. Analyses were performed with SAS software. Results: Hospitalization occurred for 78% of the cohort (N = 46 514). The median LOS was 12 (interquartile range [IQR] = 2-34) days. MPR and PDC were 61% (IQR = 29%-94%) and 59% (IQR = 31%-93%), respectively. After applying adjustments for overlapping coverage days and hospital stays independently, HA-PDC adherence values changed in 41% and 52.7% of the cohort, respectively. When adjustments for overlap and hospital stay were made concurrently, HA-PDC adherence values changed in 68% of the cohort by 5.8% (HA-PDC median = 0.68, IQR = 0.31-0.93). HA-PDC declined over time (3M-6M-9M-12M). Nearly 48% of the cohort had a ≥30 days refill gap in the first 3 months, and this increased over time (P <.0001). Conclusions: Refill gaps should be investigated carefully to capture accurate pharmacotherapy adherence. HA-PDC measures increased adherence substantially when adjustments for hospital stay and medication refill overlaps are made. Furthermore, if hospitalizations were ignored for medications that are included in Medicare quality measures, such as Medicare STAR program, the apparent reduction in adherence might be associated with lower quality and health plan reimbursement.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Systemic retinal biomarkers are biomarkers identified in the retina and related to evaluation and management of systemic disease. This review summarizes the background, categories and key findings from this body of research as well as potential applications to clinical care.Recent Findings: Potential systemic retinal biomarkers for cardiovascular disease, kidney disease and neurodegenerative disease were identified using regression analysis as well as more sophisticated image processing techniques. Deep learning techniques were used in a number of studies predicting diseases including anaemia and chronic kidney disease. A virtual coronary artery calcium score performed well against other competing traditional models of event prediction.Summary: Systemic retinal biomarker research has progressed rapidly using regression studies with clearly identified biomarkers such as retinal microvascular patterns, as well as using deep learning models. Future systemic retinal biomarker research may be able to boost performance using larger data sets, the addition of meta-data and higher resolution image inputs.

AB  - Introduction: The proportion of individuals infected with hepatitis C virus that receive direct-acting antiviral treatment is unclear.Methods: The proportion of commercially or Medicaid-insured patients receiving hepatitis C virus treatment was estimated using administrative claims data obtained from MarketScan and Multi-State Medicaid obtained on January 6, 2020. Validated algorithms derived from standardized procedures and International Classification of Diseases diagnosis codes were used to identify enrollees with chronic hepatitis C; analysis (performed November 30, 2020) was restricted to adults continuously enrolled with prescription drug coverage for >6 months before and after their index hepatitis C viral load test claim date from January 2014 through December 2018. Prescription drug claims using National Drug Codes were used for hepatitis C virus drugs. The proportion of treated patients by demographic and clinical characteristics was described, and associations with treatment were modeled using multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios and 95% CIs by insurance status.Results: Of patients with chronic hepatitis C, 12,090 of 17,562 (69%) with commercial insurance and 8,112 of 27,328 (30%) with Medicaid were treated. Commercially insured patients with opioid use disorder (hazard ratio=0.78, 95% CI=0.72, 0.85), alcohol use disorder (hazard ratio=0.85, 95% CI=0.79, 0.91), severe mental illness (hazard ratio=0.92, 95% CI=0.87, 0.98), chronic kidney disease (hazard ratio=0.75, 95% CI=0.69, 0.82), or HIV infection (hazard ratio=0.74, 95% CI=0.66, 0.82) were less likely to be treated. Medicaid patients with opioid (hazard ratio=0.64, 95% CI=0.61, 0.68) or alcohol use disorders (hazard ratio=0.83, 95% CI=0.79, 0.88) were less likely to be treated.Conclusions: Hepatitis C virus treatment gaps were identified using administrative claims data among patients with commercial and Medicaid insurance.

AB  - Background: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, which is underestimated by traditional risk stratification algorithms. We sought to determine clinical and echocardiographic predictors of adverse outcomes in CKD patients.Methods: Two hundred forty-three prospectively recruited stage 3/4 CKD patients (male, 63%; mean age, 59.2 ± 14.4 years) without previous cardiac disease made up the study cohort. All participants underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram, with left ventricular (LV) and left atrial (LA) strain analysis. Participants were followed for 3.9 ± 2.7 years for the primary end point of cardiovascular death and major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE). The secondary end point was the composite of all-cause death and MACE.Results: Fifty-four patients met the primary end point, and 65 the secondary end point. On log-rank tests, older age, diabetes mellitus, anemia, greater LV mass, reduced LV global longitudinal strain, larger indexed LA volume, higher E/e' ratio, and reduced LA reservoir strain (LASr; P < .01 for all) were independent predictors of cardiovascular death and MACE. On multivariable regression analysis of univariate predictors, LASr (P < .01) was the only independent predictor for the primary end point as well as for the secondary end point. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed LASr was a stronger predictor of adverse events (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.84) compared to the Framingham (AUC = 0.58) and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (AUC = 0.59) risk scores.Conclusions: LASr is an independent predictor of cardiovascular death and MACE in CKD patients, superior to clinical risk scores, LV parameters, and LA volume.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: We seek to determine recent advances in kidney pathophysiology that have been enabled or enhanced by artificial intelligence. We describe some of the challenges in the field as well as future directions.Recent Findings: We first provide an overview of artificial intelligence terminologies and methodologies. We then describe the use of artificial intelligence in kidney diseases to discover risk factors from clinical data for disease progression, annotate whole slide imaging and decipher multiomics data. We delineate key examples of risk stratification and prognostication in acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). We contextualize these applications in kidney disease oncology, one of the subfields to benefit demonstrably from artificial intelligence using all if these approaches. We conclude by elucidating technical challenges and ethical considerations and briefly considering future directions.Summary: The integration of clinical data, patient derived data, histology and proteomics and genomics can enhance the work of clinicians in providing more accurate diagnoses and elevating understanding of disease progression. Implementation research needs to be performed to translate these algorithms to the clinical setting.

AB  - Clinical notes from electronic health records (EHR) are important to characterize the natural history, comorbidities, and complications of ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) because these details may not be captured by claims and structured data. However, labor-intensive chart review is often required to extract information from notes. We hypothesized that machine learning can automatically discover clinically-relevant themes across longitudinal notes to study AAV. This retrospective study included prevalent PR3- or MPO-ANCA+ AAV cases managed within the Mass General Brigham integrated health care system with providers' notes available between March 1, 1990 and August 23, 2018. We generated clinically-relevant topics mentioned in notes using latent Dirichlet allocation-based topic modeling and conducted trend analyses of those topics over the 2 years prior to and 5 years after the initiation of AAV-specific treatment. The study cohort included 660 patients with AAV. We generated 90 topics using 113,048 available notes. Topics were related to the AAV diagnosis, treatment, symptoms and manifestations (e.g., glomerulonephritis), and complications (e.g., end-stage renal disease, infection). AAV-related symptoms and psychiatric symptoms were mentioned months before treatment initiation. Topics related to pulmonary and renal diseases, diabetes, and infections were common during the disease course but followed distinct temporal patterns. Automated topic modeling can be used to discover clinically-relevant themes and temporal patterns related to the diagnosis, treatment, comorbidities, and complications of AAV from EHR notes. Future research might compare the temporal patterns in a non-AAV cohort and leverage clinical notes to identify possible AAV cases prospectively. Image, graphical abstract

AB  - Objective Because carotid plaques predict the development of cardiovascular events in RA, we aimed to assess if the combined use of the systematic coronary risk evaluation (SCORE) and the QRISK3 algorithms allows for the identification of RA patients with carotid plaques in a defined population-based RA inception cohort. Methods A set of consecutive RA patients without a history of diabetes, chronic kidney disease or cardiovascular events were studied by carotid US between 2012 and 2019. Modified SCORE (mSCORE) for RA based on the 2015/2016 updated EULAR recommendations and QRISK3 algorithms were retrospectively tested using baseline data obtained at the time of the carotid US assessment. Results A total of 466 (54%) of 865 patients had carotid plaques. Using dichotomized QRISK3 and EULAR mSCORE, 73.2% (95% CI: 68.4.8, 77.6) of patients with QRISK ≥ 10% and EULAR mSCORE < 5% had plaque. In this group, the diagnostic odds ratio was 5.79 (95% CI: 4.14, 8.10). However, if both algorithms were above their thresholds of high cardiovascular risk (QRISK ≥ 10% and EULAR mSCORE ≥ 5%), the sensitivity increased up to 83.3% (95% CI: 72.1, 91.4) and the diagnostic odds ratio up to 10.6 (95% CI: 5.13, 22.0). When the risk charts scales were used as continuous variables, both QRISK3 and EULAR mSCORE were found positively associated with plaque. For each 1% QRISK3 or EULAR mSCORE increase, the probability of having plaques multiplied by 1.14 and 1.22, respectively. However, the effects of both algorithms did not multiply by each other. Conclusions. The combined use of QRISK3 and EULAR mSCORE allows for the identification of most RA patients at high risk of carotid plaques.

AB  - Aims: To describe the characteristics and antidiabetic treatment among type 2 diabetes patients according to the clinical conditions prioritized in the Spanish 2020 RedGDPS (Primary Care Diabetes Study Groups Network) therapeutic algorithm: obesity, older than 75 years, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and heart failure.Methods: Retrospective, cross-sectional study. Clinical characteristics, the use of antidiabetic drugs and the KDIGO renal risk categories at 31.12.2016 were retrieved from the SIDIAP (Information System for Research in Primary Care) database (Catalonia, Spain).Results: From a total of 373,185 type 2 diabetes patients, 37% were older than 75 years, 45% obese, 33% had chronic kidney disease, 23.2% cardiovascular disease and 6.9% heart failure. Insulin was more frequently prescribed in chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease and heart failure whereas Sodium-Glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and Glucagon Like Peptide 1 receptor agonists were scarcely prescribed (2.6% and 1.4%, respectively). Among patients with severe renal failure, contraindicated drugs like metformin (16%) and sulfonylureas (6.1%) were still in use. The 2012 KDIGO renal risk categories distribution was: Low: 60.9%, Moderate: 21.6%, High: 9.8% and Very high: 7.7%.Conclusions: Almost 80% of our T2DM patients meet one of the five clinical conditions that should be considered for treatment individualization. Importantly, a relevant number of patients with severe renal failure were found to use contraindicated drugs.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI) are global public health problems associated with a significant burden of morbidity, healthcare resource use, and all-cause mortality. This review explores recently published studies that take a machine learning approach to the diagnosis, management, and prognostication in patients with AKI or CKD.Recent Findings: The release of novel therapeutics for CKD has highlighted the importance of accurately identifying patients at the highest risk of progression. Many models have been constructed with reasonable predictive accuracy but have not been extensively externally validated and peer reviewed. Similarly, machine learning models have been developed for prediction of AKI and have found sufficient accuracy. There are issues to implementing these models, however, with conflicting results with respect to the relationship between prediction of an AKI outcome and improvements in the occurrence of other adverse events, and in some circumstances potential harm.Summary: Artificial intelligence models can help guide management of CKD and AKI, but it is important to ensure that they are broadly applicable and generalizable to various settings and associated with improved clinical decision-making and outcomes.

AB  - Objective: Cotadutide, a dual GLP-1 and glucagon receptor agonist, is under development for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and chronic kidney disease with type 2 diabetes. The effects of cotadutide on hepatic and metabolic parameters were evaluated in participants with overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes.Research Design and Methods: In this phase 2b study, 834 adults with BMI ≥25 kg/m2 and type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin (glycated hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] of 7.0%-10.5% [53-91 mmol/mol]) were randomized to double-blind cotadutide 100 μg (n = 100), 200 μg (n = 256), or 300 μg (n = 256); placebo (n = 110); or open-label liraglutide 1.8 mg (n = 110)-all administered subcutaneously. Coprimary end points were changes in HbA1c and body weight at week 14. The originally randomized interventions were continued to week 54. Liver damage biomarkers and liver fibrosis algorithms were assessed.Results: Cotadutide significantly decreased HbA1c and body weight at weeks 14 and 54 versus placebo (all P < 0.001). Improvements in lipid profile, AST and ALT levels, propeptide of type III collagen level, fibrosis-4 index, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score were observed with cotadutide 300 μg versus placebo, but not with liraglutide. Weight loss with cotadutide 200 μg was similar to that with liraglutide 1.8 mg and greater with cotadutide 300 μg versus liraglutide 1.8 mg. The most common adverse events with cotadutide (nausea, 35%; vomiting, 17%) decreased over time.Conclusions: Cotadutide treatment for 54 weeks improved glycemic control and weight loss in participants with overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes. Ad hoc analyses demonstrated improvements in hepatic parameters and support further evaluation of cotadutide in NASH.

AB  - Study Objective: Acute kidney injury occurs commonly and is a leading cause of prolonged hospitalization, development and progression of chronic kidney disease, and death. Early acute kidney injury treatment can improve outcomes. However, current decision support is not able to detect patients at the highest risk of developing acute kidney injury. We analyzed routinely collected emergency department (ED) data and developed prediction models with capacity for early identification of ED patients at high risk for acute kidney injury.Methods: A multisite, retrospective, cross-sectional study was performed at 3 EDs between January 2014 and July 2017. All adult ED visits in which patients were hospitalized and serum creatinine level was measured both on arrival and again with 72 hours were included. We built machine-learning-based classifiers that rely on vital signs, chief complaints, medical history and active medical visits, and laboratory results to predict the development of acute kidney injury stage 1 and 2 in the next 24 to 72 hours, according to creatinine-based international consensus criteria. Predictive performance was evaluated out of sample by Monte Carlo cross validation.Results: The final cohort included 91,258 visits by 59,792 unique patients. Seventy-two-hour incidence of acute kidney injury was 7.9% for stages greater than or equal to 1 and 1.0% for stages greater than or equal to 2. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for acute kidney injury prediction ranged from 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.82) to 0.74 (95% confidence interval 0.74 to 0.75), with a median time from ED arrival to prediction of 1.7 hours (interquartile range 1.3 to 2.5 hours).Conclusion: Machine learning applied to routinely collected ED data identified ED patients at high risk for acute kidney injury up to 72 hours before they met diagnostic criteria. Further prospective evaluation is necessary.

AB  - Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) occurring during hemodialysis (HD) may cause severe complications and can be life-threatening. IDH is a common symptom in patients with end stage renal disease undergoing HD. Currently, no effective predictive models for IDH exist. This study analyzed data on variations in oxygen saturation (SaO2) and heart rate (HR) in 68 patients during their HD sessions by using sequence alignment and Boolean algebra. Three classifiers derived from SaO2 and HR variation data were developed as predictors for predetermining IDH occurrence within 30 minutes. The accuracy of these classifiers in predicting IDH occurrence was approximately 80%. SaO2 and HR variations can potentially be used as predictors for developing an alarm system for detecting IDH occurrence.

AB  - Mortality prevention in T2D elderly population having Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) may be possible thorough risk assessment and predictive modeling. In this study we investigate the ability to predict mortality using heterogeneous Electronic Health Records data. Temporal abstraction is employed to transform the heterogeneous multivariate temporal data into a uniform representation of symbolic time intervals, from which then frequent Time Intervals Related Patterns (TIRPs) are discovered. However, in this study a novel representation of the TIRPs is introduced, which enables to incorporate them in Deep Learning Networks. We describe here the use of iTirps and bTirps, in which the TIRPs are represented by a integer and binary vector representing the time respectively. While bTirp represents whether a TIRP's instance was present, iTirp represents whether multiple instances were present. While the framework showed encouraging results, a major challenge is often the large number of TIRPs, which may cause the models to under-perform. We introduce a novel method for TIRPs' selection method, called TIRP Ranking Criteria (TRC), which is consists on the TIRP's metrics, such as the differences in its recurrences, its frequencies, and the average duration difference between the classes. Additionally, we introduce an advanced version, called TRC Redundant TIRP Removal (TRC-RTR), TIRPs that highly correlate are candidates for removal. Then the selected subset of iTirp/bTirps is fed into a Deep Learning architecture like a Recurrent Neural Network or a Convolutional Neural Network. Furthermore, a predictive committee is utilized in which raw data and iTirp data are both used as input. Our results show that iTirps-based models that use a subset of iTirps based on the TRC-RTR method outperform models that use raw data or models that use full set of discovered iTirps.

AB  - Coronary heart disease is an important source of mortality and morbidity among kidney transplantation and liver transplantation candidates and recipients and is driven by traditional and nontraditional risk factors related to end-stage organ disease. In this scientific statement, we review evidence from the past decade related to coronary heart disease screening and management for kidney and liver transplantation candidates. Coronary heart disease screening in asymptomatic kidney and liver transplantation candidates has not been demonstrated to improve outcomes but is common in practice. Risk stratification algorithms based on the presence or absence of clinical risk factors and physical performance have been proposed, but a high proportion of candidates still meet criteria for screening tests. We suggest new approaches to pretransplantation evaluation grounded on the presence or absence of known coronary heart disease and cardiac symptoms and emphasize multidisciplinary engagement, including involvement of a dedicated cardiologist. Noninvasive functional screening methods such as stress echocardiography and myocardial perfusion scintigraphy have limited accuracy, and newer noninvasive modalities, especially cardiac computed tomography-based tests, are promising alternatives. Emerging evidence such as results of the 2020 International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches-Chronic Kidney Disease trial emphasizes the vital importance of guideline-directed medical therapy in managing diagnosed coronary heart disease and further questions the value of revascularization among asymptomatic kidney transplantation candidates. Optimizing strategies to disseminate and implement best practices for medical management in the broader end-stage organ disease population should be prioritized to improve cardiovascular outcomes in these populations.

AB  - Background: Steroid resistant (SR) nephrotic syndrome (NS) affects up to 30% of children and is responsible for fast progression to end stage renal disease. Currently there is no early prognostic marker of SR and studied candidate variants and parameters differ highly between distinct ethnic cohorts.Methods: Here, we analyzed 11polymorphic variants, 6 mutations, SOCS3 promoter methylation and biochemical parameters as prognostic markers in a group of 124 Polish NS children (53 steroid resistant, 71 steroid sensitive including 31 steroid dependent) and 55 controls. We used single marker and multiple logistic regression analysis, accompanied by prediction modeling using neural network approach.Results: We achieved 92% (AUC = 0.778) SR prediction for binomial and 63% for multinomial calculations, with the strongest predictors ABCB1 rs1922240, rs1045642 and rs2235048, CD73 rs9444348 and rs4431401, serum creatinine and unmethylated SOCS3 promoter region. Next, we achieved 80% (AUC = 0.720) in binomial and 63% in multinomial prediction of SD, with the strongest predictors ABCB1 rs1045642 and rs2235048. Haplotype analysis revealed CD73_AG to be associated with SR while ABCB1_AGT was associated with SR, SD and membranoproliferative pattern of kidney injury regardless the steroid response.Conclusions: We achieved prediction of steroid resistance and, as a novelty, steroid dependence, based on early markers in NS children. Such predictions, prior to drug administration, could facilitate decision on a proper treatment and avoid diverse effects of high steroid doses.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is currently defined as the presence of proteinuria and/or an eGFR < 60 mL / min / 1.73 m 2 on the basis of the renal diagnosis. The global dimension of CKD is relevant, since its prevalence and incidence have doubled in the past three decades worldwide. A major complication that occurs in CKD patients is the development of cardiovascular (CV) disease, being the incidence rate of fatal/nonfatal CV events similar to the rate of ESKD in CKD. Moreover, CKD is a multifactorial disease where multiple mechanisms contribute to the individual prognosis. The correct development of novel biomarkers of CV risk may help clinicians to ameliorate the management of CKD patients. Biomarkers of CV risk in CKD patients are classifiable as prognostic, which help to improve CV risk prediction regardless of treatment, and predictive, which allow the selection of individuals who are likely to respond to a specific treatment. Several prognostic (cystatin C, cardiac troponins, markers of inflammation, and fibrosis) and predictive (genes, metalloproteinases, and complex classifiers) biomarkers have been developed. Despite previous biomarkers providing information on the pathophysiological mechanisms of CV risk in CKD beyond proteinuria and eGFR, only a minority have been adopted in clinical use. This mainly depends on heterogeneous results and lack of validation of biomarkers. The purpose of this review is to present an update on the already assessed biomarkers of CV risk in CKD and examine the strategies for a correct development of biomarkers in clinical practice. Development of both predictive and prognostic biomarkers is an important task for nephrologists. Predictive biomarkers are useful for designing novel clinical trials (enrichment design) and for better understanding of the variability in response to the current available treatments for CV risk. Prognostic biomarkers could help to improve risk stratification and anticipate diagnosis of CV disease, such as heart failure and coronary heart disease.

AB  - Objective: Vitamin D has beneficial effects on vascular endothelial function, blood pressure (BP) and arterial stiffness. Arterial stiffness increases in early-stage hypertensive patients and it is a strong predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH D) levels and arterial stiffness in patients with newly diagnosed hypertension.Method: Our study included 100 newly diagnosed hypertensive patients (63 male, 37 female and mean age: 51.7 ± 10.3 years) without cardiovascular disease, malignancy, chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus. Patients were divided into two groups: vitamin D deficiency group (<20 ng/ml) and normal vitamin D group (≥20 ng/ml). Twenty-four-hour, daytime and nighttime ambulatory BP readings were recorded. Mobil-O-Graph ARC solver algorithm was used to evaluate arterial stiffness parameters of pulse wave velocity (PWV) (m/s), augmentation index normalized with 75/min heart rate (Alx@75).Results: Patients with vitamin D deficency had higher values of Alx@75 and PWV values (20.9 ± 9 vs. 16.8 ± 6.9, P = 0.018 and 8.37 ± 1.16 vs. 6.9 ± 0.9, P = 0.001, respectively) despite similar 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring in both groups. Level of serum calcium was significantly higher in vitamin D deficiency group (9.5 ± 0.23 vs. 9.3 ± 0.12, P = 0.007). Nighttime SBP was higher in vitamin D deficiency group (133.2 ± 14.3 mmHg vs. 126.3 ± 17.2 mmHg; P = 0.03) and also, vitamin D deficiency group had non-dipping SBP pattern compared to normal Vitamin D group (P = 0.013).Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased arterial stiffness in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients in terms of increased PWV and Alx@75 values.

AB  - Background: Although comorbidity is important in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), few validated methods for its assessment exist. Our aim is to estimate the prevalence and economic burden of major comorbidities in people with MS (pwMS) in two Northern Italy study areas (Pavia, PV and Genoa, GE), using routinely collected healthcare data. Methods: We estimated prevalence of comorbid conditions in pwMS in the period 2012-2017. Anxiety, depression, cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, hypertension, heart disease, cerebrovascular diseases, vascular diseases, ischemic stroke, hyperlipidaemia, bronchopathy, diabetes, gastropathy, gastric ulcer, autoimmune diseases, chronic renal failure, connective tissue diseases and HIV/AIDS were identified by a specific algorithm currently used for monitoring prevalence of chronic diseases by Italian Local Health Authorities (BDA system). Direct healthcare costs were defined by regional and governmental contracts; the aggregated healthcare expenditure was compared between pwMS with/without comorbidities. Results: The MS cases identified were 2983, 2035 in GE and 948 in PV. 55.6% of pwMS had at least one comorbidity (50.6% GE and 66.5% PV, p < 0.001). The most prevalent comorbidities were: depression (32.9%), hypertension (18.0%), cancer (10.9%), heart disease (7.8%), cerebrovascular diseases (7.0%) and hyperlipidaemia (6.1%). Comorbidity ranking was similar in the two provinces, although we observed significant differences considering specific prevalence rates. The mean direct healthcare costs of MS were substantially higher for individuals with comorbidity (36,463 €vs 26,284 €, p < 0.001), showing 39% of additive costs. Conclusions: Our study provides evidence of the burden of comorbidities in MS. Comorbidity is common in MS and produce additive costs. Key messages: The use of administrative data for tracking the MS comorbidity could help knowledge gaps. When additivity situation is involved, preventive policies could lead to monetary savings.

AB  - Objective: Secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound nanoparticles released from cells. Since their content reflect the specific signatures of cellular activation and injury, EVs display a strong potential as biomarkers in the cardiovascular (CV) field. We aimed at dissecting a specific EV signature able to stratify patients according to their CV risk and likelihood to develop fatal CV events.Design and Method: A total of 404 patients were included in the analysis. For each subject, we evaluated several CV risk indicators (age, sex, BMI, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, smoking habit, organ damage) and the likelihood of fatal CV events at 10 years, according to the SCORE charts of the European Society of Cardiology. Serum EVs were isolated by immuno-capture and analyzed for the expression of 37 EV surface antigens by flow cytometry. Unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms were applied for clustering patients according to CV risk.Results: Based on expression levels of EV antigens, unsupervised learning classified patients into three clusters (cluster I, 288 patients; cluster II, 86 patients; cluster III, 30 patients). Prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, chronic heart failure and organ damage (defined as left ventricular hypertrophy and/or microalbuminuria) progressively increases from cluster I to cluster III, with an average 6.9-fold increase. Several EV antigens, including markers from platelets (CD41b-CD42a-CD62P), leukocytes (CD1c-CD2-CD3-CD4-CD8-CD14-CD19-CD20-CD25-CD40-CD45-CD69-CD86), and endothelium (CD31-CD105) were independently associated to the CV risk indicators and correlated to age, blood pressure, glucometabolic profile, renal function, and SCORE risk. EV specific signature obtained by supervised learning allowed the accurate classification of patients according to their 10-year risk of future CV events, as estimated with the SCORE risk charts.Conclusions: EV profiling, obtainable from minimally-invasive blood sampling, may be integrated into CV risk stratification, displaying a potential role in the tailored management of these patients.

AB  - Objective: Mendelian rioritisedn (MR) uses genetic variants as instruments to estimate a causal effect of an exposure on an outcome. Specific conditions need to be satisfied to ensure the validity of the genetic variant as an instrumental variable (IV). Pleiotropy is one of the reasons for invalid IV and erroneous causal estimation. We applied natural language processing (NLP) on multidimensional GWAS datasets enriched with gene-expression information to select appropriate IVs for MR analysis. The selected set of IVs was then used in MR analysis to investigate the causal effect of blood pressure (BP) on cardiovascular outcomes (ischaemic stroke, atrial fibrillation (AF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD)).Design and Method: We curated corpus of data by integrating GWAS results, gene expression, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) proxies and proximate genes on 2955 phenotypes. We used chromosome cytobands to partition the genome into documents, in which SNPs, genes, tissues and phenotype domains are treated as the terms. We subsequently calculated term frequency - inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) for all the terms in the corpus and identified the cytobands with the highest TF-IDF for BP. Independent non-pleiotropic SNPs associated with BP in the rioritised cytogenetic bands were selected as IVs for two-sample MR analysis. We performed inverse-variance weighted (IVW) MR and MR Egger analysis using GWAS meta-analysis systolic BP (SBP) estimates and the following outcomes: ischaemic stroke (N = 440328), AF (N = 1030836), CAD (N = 547261), CKD (N = 117165). Analyses were performed on the MR-Base platform.Results: We identified 10 non-pleiotropic, BP-associated SNPs from the top 10 cytobands with the highest TF-IDF scores for BP over the whole genome. Two-sample MR analyses showed a significant causal relationship between genetically determined greater SBP and higher risk of ischemic stroke, AF but not for CAD and CKD (ischemic stroke: IVW = 0.03 ± 0.01, P = 0.006; MR-Egger = 0.05 ± 0.02, P = 0.09; AF: IVW = 0.03 ± 0.006, P = 9.017E-07; MR-Egger = 0.04 ± 0.01, P = 0.01) (Figure).Conclusions: Our joint NLP and MR analyses allowed selection of a parsimonious set of instrumental variable SNPs for MR analyses and may be an option for high-throughput analyses across multiple traits.

AB  - Objectives: Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota dysbiosis plays a critical role in chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the relationship between altered gut microbiome profiles and disease severity remains unclear. In this study, we sought to characterize the gut microbiota in CKD patients compared to healthy controls, and to explore potential relationships between gut microbiota composition and disease severity. Methods: Fecal samples were collected from 95 patients at different stages of CKD (non-dialysis patients from stage 1 to 5) and 20 healthy controls. Bacterial DNA was extracted for 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing targeting the V3-V4 region. The diversity and relative abundance of gut microbiota were analyzed as outcome indicators. Results: Differences were observed in the microbial composition and diversity of fecal samples from CKD patients and healthy controls. Specifically, disease severity was found to alter gut microbiota composition. Compared to that in healthy controls, CKD patients showed an increased abundance of Proteobacteria and decreased Synergistetes, most notably in disease stage 5. Lower levels of butyrate-producing bacteria and higher levels of potential pathogens were also detected in CKD patients. Further, Pyramidobacter and Prevotellaceae_UCG-001 were significantly decreased in the CKD1 group compared with healthy controls. Notably, nine microbial genera, including Escherichia-Shigella, Parabacteroides, Roseburia, rectale_group, Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group, Prevotellaceae_UCG.001, Hungatella, Intestinimonas, and Pyramidobacter, identified using a random forest model, distinguished between patients with CKD and healthy controls with high accuracy. Functional analysis also revealed that fatty acid and inositol phosphate metabolism were enriched in the CKD group, while aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis, thiamine metabolism, pantothenate, and CoA biosynthesis, as well as valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis were enriched in healthy controls. Conclusion: Gut microbiota composition and function are associated with CKD severity. And, specific gut microbes are potentially helpful for CKD early diagnosis and prognosis monitoring.

AB  - Background. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is a public health problem worldwide. Kidney transplantation (KT) is the best treatment for elderly patients' longevity and quality of life. Objectives. The primary endpoint was to compare elderly versus younger KT recipients by analyzing the risk covariables involved in worsening renal function, proteinuria, graft loss, and death one year after KT. The secondary endpoint was to create a robot based on logistic regression capable of predicting the likelihood that elderly recipients will develop worse renal function one year after KT. Method. Unicentric retrospective analysis of a cohort was performed with individuals aged ≥60 and <60 years old. We analysed medical records of KT recipients from January to December 2017, with a follow-up time of one year after KT. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate odds ratios for elderly vs younger recipients, controlled for demographic, clinical, laboratory, data pre- and post-KT, and death. Results. 18 elderly and 100 younger KT recipients were included. Pretransplant immune variables were similar between two groups. No significant differences (P > 0.05) between groups were observed after KT on laboratory data means and for the prevalences of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, acute rejection, cytomegalovirus, polyomavirus, and urinary infections. One year after KT, the creatinine clearance was higher (P = 0.006) in youngers (70.9 ± 25.2 mL/min/1.73 m2) versus elderlies (53.3 ± 21.1 mL/min/1.73 m2). There was no difference in death outcome comparison. Multivariable analysis among covariables predisposing chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 presented a statistical significance for age ≥60 years (P = 0.01) and reduction in serum haemoglobin (P = 0.03). The model presented goodness-fit in the evaluation of artificial intelligence metrics (precision: 90%; sensitivity: 71%; and F1 score: 0.79). Conclusion. Renal function in elderly KT recipients was lower than in younger KT recipients. However, patients aged ≥60 years maintained enough renal function to remain off dialysis. Moreover, a learning machine application built a robot (Elderly KTbot) to predict in the elderly populations the likelihood of worse renal function one year after KT.

AB  - Background: Estimating CKD prevalence is difficult. Information on CKD prevalence is rather scanty in Italy and available figures come from surveys in selected geographical areas. Administrative data have been already demonstrated to be an effective tool in estimating the epidemiological burden of diseases, however there is limited experience in literature as far as CKD is concerned.Methods: The aim of this study is to develop an algorithm based on regional Health Administrative Databases to identify individuals with CKD and provide estimates of disease prevalence in Lazio Region (Italy); about 5.500.000 inhabitants in 2017. A population-level analysis based on a record-linkage strategy using data from Health Administrative Databases has been applied in Lazio Region. CKD cases were identified between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2017 using Outpatient Specialist Service Information System, Hospital Discharge Registry, Ticket Exemption Registry and Drug Dispensing Registry. Age-specific and standardized prevalence rates were calculated by gender. CKD cases were classified as higher and lower severity.Results: The algorithm identified 99,457 individuals with CKD (mean age 71 years, 55.8% males). The exclusive contributions of each regional source used were: 35,047 (35.2%) from Outpatient Specialist Service Information System, 27,778 (27.9%) from Hospital Discharge Registry, 4143 (4.2%) from Ticket Exemption Registry and 463 (0.5%) from Drug Dispensing Registry; 5.1% of cases were found in all databases. The standardized prevalence rate at December 31, 2017 was 1.76, 2.06% for males and 1.50% for females. The prevalence increased with age, rising from 0.33% (age 0-18) up to 14.18% (age 85+) among males and from 0.25% up to 8.18% among females. The proportion of CKD individuals with lower severity disease was 78.7% in both genders.Conclusions: The proposed algorithm represents a novel tool to monitor the burden of CKD disease, that can be used by the regional government to guide the development and implementation of evidence-based pathways of care for CKD patients. The high prevalence of people with CKD of lower severity should be carefully considered in order to promote diagnosis and optimal management at early stages.

AB  - National and international registries have great potential for providing data that describe disease burden, treatments, and outcomes especially in rare diseases. In the setting of pediatric end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the available data are limited to highly developed countries, whereas the lack of data from emerging economies blurs the global perspective. In order to improve the pediatric dialysis care worldwide, provide global benchmarking of pediatric dialysis outcome, and assign useful tools and management algorithms based on evidence-based medicine, the International Pediatric Peritoneal Dialysis Network (IPPN) was established in 2007. In recent years, the Registry has provided comprehensive data on relevant clinical issues in pediatric peritoneal dialysis patients including nutritional status, growth, cardiovascular disease, anemia management, mineral and bone disorders, preservation of residual kidney function, access-related complications, and impact of associated comorbidities. A unique feature of the registry is the ability to compare practices and outcomes between countries and world regions. In the current review, we describe study design and collection methods, summarize the core IPPN findings based on its 12-year experience and 13 publications, and discuss the future perspective.

AB  - Key Points: Question: What is the effect of a precision nutrition intervention aimed to reduce the postprandial glycemic response to foods on weight loss in adults with abnormal glucose metabolism and obesity compared with a low-fat diet? Findings: In this randomized clinical trial that included 204 adults who received web-based group behavioral counseling, there was no significant difference in percentage of weight loss at 6 months between participants who followed a personalized diet compared with those who followed a standardized low-fat diet. Meaning: This study found that a precision nutrition intervention targeting a reduction in postprandial glycemic response did not result in greater weight loss compared with a low-fat diet. This randomized clinical trial compares personalized vs standardized caloric-restricted weight loss interventions in terms of percentage of weight loss among adults with high postprandial glycemic responses and obesity. Importance: Interindividual variability in postprandial glycemic response (PPGR) to the same foods may explain why low glycemic index or load and low-carbohydrate diet interventions have mixed weight loss outcomes. A precision nutrition approach that estimates personalized PPGR to specific foods may be more efficacious for weight loss. Objective: To compare a standardized low-fat vs a personalized diet regarding percentage of weight loss in adults with abnormal glucose metabolism and obesity. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Personal Diet Study was a single-center, population-based, 6-month randomized clinical trial with measurements at baseline (0 months) and 3 and 6 months conducted from February 12, 2018, to October 28, 2021. A total of 269 adults aged 18 to 80 years with a body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) ranging from 27 to 50 and a hemoglobin A1c level ranging from 5.7% to 8.0% were recruited. Individuals were excluded if receiving medications other than metformin or with evidence of kidney disease, assessed as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation, to avoid recruiting patients with advanced type 2 diabetes. Interventions: Participants were randomized to either a low-fat diet (<25% of energy intake; standardized group) or a personalized diet that estimates PPGR to foods using a machine learning algorithm (personalized group). Participants in both groups received a total of 14 behavioral counseling sessions and self-monitored dietary intake. In addition, the participants in the personalized group received color-coded meal scores on estimated PPGR delivered via a mobile app. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the percentage of weight loss from baseline to 6 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in body composition (fat mass, fat-free mass, and percentage of body weight), resting energy expenditure, and adaptive thermogenesis. Data were collected at baseline and 3 and 6 months. Analysis was based on intention to treat using linear mixed modeling. Results: Of a total of 204 adults randomized, 199 (102 in the personalized group vs 97 in the standardized group) contributed data (mean [SD] age, 58 [11] years; 133 women [66.8%]; mean [SD] body mass index, 33.9 [4.8]). Weight change at 6 months was −4.31% (95% CI, −5.37% to −3.24%) for the standardized group and −3.26% (95% CI, −4.25% to −2.26%) for the personalized group, which was not significantly different (difference between groups, 1.05% [95% CI, −0.40% to 2.50%]; P =.16). There were no between-group differences in body composition and adaptive thermogenesis; however, the change in resting energy expenditure was significantly greater in the standardized group from 0 to 6 months (difference between groups, 92.3 [95% CI, 0.9-183.8] kcal/d; P =.05). Conclusions and Relevance: A personalized diet targeting a reduction in PPGR did not result in greater weight loss compared with a low-fat diet at 6 months. Future studies should assess methods of increasing dietary self-monitoring adherence and intervention exposure. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03336411

AB  - To investigate if the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) and the QRISK3 algorithms as well as the carotid ultrasound are useful predictors of cardiovascular (CV) events and death in a prospectively defined population-based rheumatoid arthritis (RA) inception cohort. A set of 327 consecutive RA patients without history of diabetes, chronic kidney disease or CV events were studied by carotid ultrasound between 2012 and 2013. At that time, CV risk was calculated according to the modified EULAR systematic coronary risk evaluation (mSCORE) for RA. A five-year prospective follow-up study was conducted by survival analysis models. The EULAR mSCORE based on the 2015/2016 updated EULAR recommendations and the QRISK3 algorithms were retrospectively tested using baseline data. After 1,984.25 patient-years of follow-up, 23 had died and 27 had experienced CV events. Linearized mortality rate was 1.16/100 patient-years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.74--1.73). Adjusting for age, gender and disease duration, a model with carotid plaques (Hazard ratio [HR]: 6.10 [95% CI:0.74--50.0]; p = 0.09) and another model with carotid plaques and QRISK3 (HR for carotid plaques: 6.12 [95% CI: 0.74--50.5]; p = 0.09 and HR for each 1% in QRISK3: 1.03 [95% CI: 0.99--1.07], p = 0.11, respectively were the best predictors of death whereas a model with carotid plaques (HR: 5.25 [95% CI:1.41--19.50]; p = 0.01) and another model with carotid plaques and QRISK3 (HR for carotid plaques: 5.13 [95% CI: 1.36--19.3]; p = 0.02 and HR for each 1% in QRISK3: 1.03 [95% CI: 0.99--1.07], p = 0.12, respectively, were the best predictors of CV events. In contrast, the mSCORE was a weaker predictor of the risk of death or CV events. The presence of carotid plaques predicts the development of CV events and death in patients with RA. The predictable capacity of carotid plaques and QRISK3 is higher than that of mSCORE in RA patients.

AB  - Background: Healthcare needs are complex and heterogeneous in advanced chronic organ failure. However, based on symptom clusters, groups of patients with similar quality of life, care dependency and life-sustaining treatment preferences can be identified. Aims: To evaluate the stability of symptom-based clusters over time, and whether and to what extent the clusters are able to predict patients' 2-year survival and hospitalization rates. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of a longitudinal observational study including 95 outpatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) GOLD stage III–IV, 80 outpatients with chronic heart failure (CHF) NYHA stage III–IV and 80 outpatients with chronic renal failure (CRF) requiring dialysis. Patients were clustered into three groups applying K-means algorithm on baseline symptoms' severity and were then longitudinally evaluated. 2-year survival and hospital admissions during 1 year were estimated using Kaplan–Meier curves and Cox models. 1-year tendencies in symptom variation, using mixed linear models, and clusters comparison over time were performed. Results: The three clusters were unable to predict patients' survival and hospital admissions. Noteworthy, they show different trajectories of symptom variation, with Cluster 1 patients experiencing a worsening of symptoms, associated with an increased care dependency, and Cluster 2 and Cluster 3 patients being stable or having a relief in some symptoms. Although Cluster 1 is becoming more similar to Cluster 2, the three clusters preserve the overall characteristics and differences. Discussion: Symptom-based clusters might help to identify patients with different trajectories of symptom variations. Conclusion: Symptom clusters do not predict survival and hospital admissions and are stable over time.

AB  - Objectives This study aimed to examine the sensitivity of muscle biopsy (MB) in ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV), identify factors predicting MB positivity and assess the prognostic value of a positive MB. Methods We conducted a single-centre retrospective study of AAV with an MB performed at diagnosis. AAV classification [granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA)] followed the European Medicines Agency algorithm. A logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with MB positivity. Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan–Meier method. Results Among 276 AAV patients (1995–2018), 101 had an MB. Seventy-eight patients were included: 33 with GPA, 25 with MPA and 20 with EGPA. MB samples were positive in 45 cases (58%): 17 GPA, 16 MPA and 12 EGPA. Univariate analysis focussed on GPA and MPA, revealed that the MB yield was higher in females [22/31 (71%) vs 11/27 (41%); P  = 0.02] and in anti-MPO patients [25/37 (68%) vs 6/19 (32%) for anti-PR3; P  = 0.01]. By multivariate analysis, three factors predicted MB positivity: anti-MPO ANCA [odds ratio (OR) 10.67 (CI 2.09, 81.68)], female sex [OR 5.3 (CI 1.16, 32.35)] and neutrophil count [OR 1.33 (CI 1.07, 1.8)]. MB positivity had no impact on relapse, death or end-stage renal disease–free survival. Conclusions MB is a safe and efficient diagnostic tool for AAV. Predictors of MB yield include ANCA type, sex and neutrophil count. MB cannot substitute for kidney biopsy when indicated, but should be considered in other cases.

AB  - Background: The performance of previously published glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation equations degrades when directly used in Chinese population. We incorporated more independent variables and using complicated non-linear modeling technology (artificial neural network, ANN) to develop a more accurate GFR estimation model for Chinese population.Methods: The enrolled participants came from the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, China from Jan 2012 to Jun 2016. Participants with age < 18, unstable kidney function, taking trimethoprim or cimetidine, or receiving dialysis were excluded. Among the finally enrolled 1952 participants, 1075 participants (55.07%) from Jan 2012 to Dec 2014 were assigned as the development data whereas 877 participants (44.93%) from Jan 2015 to Jun 2016 as the internal validation data. We in total developed 3 GFR estimation models: a 4-variable revised CKD-EPI (chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration) equation (standardized serum creatinine and cystatin C, age and gender), a 9-variable revised CKD-EPI equation (additional auxiliary variables: body mass index, blood urea nitrogen, albumin, uric acid and hemoglobin), and a 9-variable ANN model.Results: Compared with the 4-variable equation, the 9-variable equation could not achieve superior performance in the internal validation data (mean of difference: 5.00 [3.82, 6.54] vs 4.67 [3.55, 5.90], P = 0.5; interquartile range (IQR) of difference: 18.91 [17.43, 20.48] vs 20.11 [18.46, 21.80], P = 0.05; P30: 76.6% [73.7%, 79.5%] vs 75.8% [72.9%, 78.6%], P = 0.4), but the 9-variable ANN model significantly improve bias and P30 accuracy (mean of difference: 2.77 [1.82, 4.10], P = 0.007; IQR: 19.33 [17.77, 21.17], P = 0.3; P30: 80.0% [77.4%, 82.7%], P < 0.001).Conclusions: It is suggested that using complicated non-linear models like ANN could fully utilize the predictive ability of the independent variables, and then finally achieve a superior GFR estimation model.

AB  - A recent development of immunosuppressive protocols (or simply, suppressants) offers a new option to patients suffering from end-stage renal disease: transplants from biologically incompatible donors. Suppressants are currently being used for direct transplants within patient-donor pairs, but they can be utilized more efficiently when combined with kidney exchanges. To assess the welfare gains from doing so, we introduce the "minimum chains algorithms" for different sizes of feasible exchanges. Using these algorithms, we calculate the minimal number of suppressants needed for transplants for a group of patient-donor pairs. Our simulation results show that (i) a significant reduction of suppressants can be achieved by implementing this proposal, (ii) it suffices to arrange 2-way exchanges for the best use of suppressants, and (iii) the welfare gain varies with the ABO blood-type distribution, and the gain in Korea appears to be larger than that in the United States. Finally, we assess the value (or cost) of each patient-donor pair by comparing the outcomes of the pools with and without the pair.

AB  - Kidney renal failure means that one's kidney have unexpectedly stopped functioning, i.e., once chronic disease is exposed, the presence or degree of kidney dysfunction and its progression must be assessed, and the underlying syndrome has to be diagnosed. Although the patient's history and physical examination may denote good practice, some key information has to be obtained from valuation of the glomerular filtration rate, and the analysis of serum biomarkers. Indeed, chronic kidney sickness depicts anomalous kidney function and/or its makeup, i.e., there is evidence that treatment may avoid or delay its progression, either by reducing and prevent the development of some associated complications, namely hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular complications. Acute kidney injury appears abruptly, with a rapid deterioration of the renal function, but is often reversible if it is recognized early and treated promptly. In both situations, i.e., acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease, an early intervention can significantly improve the prognosis. The assessment of these pathologies is therefore mandatory, although it is hard to do it with traditional methodologies and existing tools for problem solving. Hence, in this work, we will focus on the development of a hybrid decision support system, in terms of its knowledge representation and reasoning procedures based on Logic Programming, that will allow one to consider incomplete, unknown, and even contradictory information, complemented with an approach to computing centered on Artificial Neural Networks, in order to weigh the Degree-of-Confidence that one has on such a happening. The present study involved 558 patients with an age average of 51.7 years and the chronic kidney disease was observed in 175 cases. The dataset comprise twenty four variables, grouped into five main categories. The proposed model showed a good performance in the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, since the sensitivity and the specificity exhibited values range between 93.1 and 94.9 and 91.9-94.2 %, respectively.

AB  - Background: IgA vasculitis (IgAV) is the most common form of systemic vasculitis in childhood and frequently involves the kidney. A minority of patients with IgA vasculitis nephritis (IgAVN), especially those presenting with heavy proteinuria and/or kidney failure at onset, are at risk of chronic end-stage kidney disease. For deciding upon treatment intensity, knowledge of the short-term clinical course of IgAVN is needed to improve treatment algorithms.Methods: For this retrospective multicenter study, the medical records of 66 children with biopsy-proven IgAVN were reviewed. Age, gender, medical history and therapeutic interventions were recorded. Laboratory data included serum creatinine, albumin, urinary protein excretion (UPE) and glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Threshold values were determined for each parameter, full remission was defined as no proteinuria and eGFR > 90 ml/min/1.73m2.Results: Median age at onset of IgAVN was 8.9 years. 14.1% of the children presented with nephrotic syndrome, 50% had an eGFR below 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 51.5% showed cellular crescents in renal histology. The treatment regimens varied notably. Forty-four patients were treated with immunosuppression; 17 patients with crescents or nephrotic syndrome were treated with corticosteroid (CS) pulse therapy. After 6 months, UPE had decreased from 3.7 to 0.3 g/g creatinine and the proportion of patients with a decreased eGFR had fallen from 50.0% to 35.5%. Thirteen children (26.5%) achieved full remission within 6 months.Conclusions: In most patients with IgAVN proteinuria decreases slowly and kidney function improves, but full remission is reached only in a minority after 6 months. Persistent heavy proteinuria in the first two months rarely developed into long-term proteinuria. Therefore, decisions for more intense treatment should take into account the course of UPE over time. For a comparison of treatment effects, patient numbers were too small. Prospective, randomized controlled trials are necessary to clarify risk factors and the effect of immunosuppressive therapies.

AB  - Introduction: Administrative data is increasingly used for chronic disease surveillance; however, its validity to define cases of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children is unknown. We sought to evaluate the performance of case definitions for CKD in children.Methods: We utilized population-based administrative data from the Manitoba Center for Health Policy to evaluate the validity of algorithms based on a combination of hospital claims, outpatient physician visits, and pharmaceutical use over 1-3 years in children <18 years of age. Algorithms were compared with a laboratory-based definition (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 and/or presence of proteinuria).Results: All algorithms evaluated had very low sensitivity (0.20-0.39) and moderate positive predictive value (0.52-0.68). Algorithms had excellent specificity (0.98-0.99) and negative predictive value (0.96-0.97). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves indicate fair accuracy (0.60-0.68). Sensitivity improved with increasing years of data. One or more physician claims and one or more prescriptions over 3 years had the highest sensitivity and ROC.Conclusions: The sensitivity of administrative data algorithms for CKD is unacceptably low for a screening test. Specificity is excellent; therefore, children without CKD are correctly identified. Alternate data sources are required for population-based surveillance of this important chronic disease.

AB  - Congenital lower urinary tract obstruction is associated with oligohydramnios and significant perinatal mortality and long-term chronic kidney disease. The counseling of families facing this diagnosis, especially when prenatal intervention is proposed, is fraught with ambiguity. This review aims to equip the provider with the current evidence behind the conventional and novel biomarkers predictive of chronic kidney disease. The relevant clinical predictors are categorized by when they are identified, antenatally or postnatally, and as either anatomic or chemical. They are considered for their prognostic value and the challenges in obtaining them, specifically the risk to the fetus in the case of prenatal biomarkers. Serum creatinine in infancy is the traditional chemical biomarker of kidney function and continues to be a consistent predictor of future serum creatinine. β-2 microglobulin may provide earlier information regarding fetal glomerular and tubular function and is also predictive of long-term serum creatinine. Renal parenchymal area is an anatomic surrogate of nephron mass that is used in both prenatal and postnatal settings. Understanding the anatomic and chemical biomarkers is essential for future refinement of the staging algorithm used to distinguish which patients may benefit from early in utero intervention.

AB  - Background: Amoxicillin is the first-line treatment for streptococcal or enterococcal infective endocarditis (IE) with a dose regimen adapted to weight.Objectives: Covariates influencing pharmacokinetics (PK) of amoxicillin were identified in order to develop a dosing nomogram based on identified covariates for individual adaptation.Patients and Methods: Patients treated with amoxicillin administered by continuous infusion for IE were included retrospectively. The population PK analysis was performed using the Pmetrics package for R (NPAG algorithm). Influence of weight, ideal weight, height, BMI, body surface area, glomerular filtration rate adapted to the body surface area and calculated by the CKD-EPI method (mL/min), additional ceftriaxone treatment and serum protein level on amoxicillin PK was tested. A nomogram was then developed to determine the daily dose needed to achieve a steady-state free plasma concentration above 4× MIC, 100% of the time, without exceeding a total plasma concentration of 80 mg/L.Results: A total of 160 patients were included. Population PK analysis was performed on 540 amoxicillin plasma concentrations. A two-compartment model best described amoxicillin PK and the glomerular filtration rate covariate significantly improved the model when included in the calculation of the elimination constant Ke.Conclusions: This work allowed the development of a dosing nomogram that can help to increase achievement of the PK/pharmacodynamic targets in IE treated with amoxicillin.

AB  - Risk stratification of young patients with hypertension remains challenging. Generally, machine learning (ML) is considered a promising alternative to traditional methods for clinical predictions because it is capable of processing large amounts of complex data. We, therefore, explored the feasibility of an ML approach for predicting outcomes in young patients with hypertension and compared its performance with that of approaches now commonly used in clinical practice. Baseline clinical data and a composite end point-comprising all-cause death, acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery revascularization, new-onset heart failure, new-onset atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, sustained ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, peripheral artery revascularization, new-onset stroke, end-stage renal disease-were evaluated in 508 young patients with hypertension (30.83±6.17 years) who had been treated at a tertiary hospital. Construction of the ML model, which consisted of recursive feature elimination, extreme gradient boosting, and 10-fold cross-validation, was performed at the 33-month follow-up evaluation, and the model's performance was compared with that of the Cox regression and recalibrated Framingham Risk Score models. An 11-variable combination was considered most valuable for predicting outcomes using the ML approach. The C statistic for identifying patients with composite end points was 0.757 (95% CI, 0.660-0.854) for the ML model, whereas for Cox regression model and the recalibrated Framingham Risk Score model it was 0.723 (95% CI, 0.636-0.810) and 0.529 (95% CI, 0.403-0.655). The ML approach was comparable with Cox regression for determining the clinical prognosis of young patients with hypertension and was better than that of the recalibrated Framingham Risk Score model.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: The current review will describe the current evidence and mechanisms of acute kidney injury (AKI) as a risk factor for long-term kidney complications, summarize the rationale for AKI follow-up and present an approach to monitoring children with AKI. Despite emerging evidence linking AKI with risk for long-term kidney and cardiovascular outcomes, many children who develop AKI are not followed for kidney disease development after hospital discharge. Better understanding of long-term complications after AKI and practical algorithms for follow-up will hopefully increase the rate and quality of post-AKI monitoring.Recent Findings: Recent evidence shows that pediatric AKI is associated with long-term renal outcomes such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension, both known to increase cardiovascular risk. The mechanism of AKI progression to CKD involves maladaptive regeneration of tubular epithelial and endothelial cells, inflammation, fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis. Many AKI survivors are not followed, and no guidelines for pediatric AKI follow-up have been published.Summary: Children who had AKI are at increased risk of long-term renal complications but many of them are not monitored for these complications. Recognizing long-term outcomes post-AKI and integration of follow-up programs may have a long-lasting positive impact on patient health.

AB  - Background: Systematic identification of patients allows researchers and clinicians to test new models of care delivery. EHR phenotypes-structured algorithms based on clinical indicators from EHRs-can aid in such identification.Objective: To develop EHR phenotypes to identify decedents with stage 4 solid-tumor cancer or stage 4-5 chronic kidney disease (CKD).Design: We developed two EHR phenotypes. Each phenotype included International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 and ICD-10 codes. We used natural language processing (NLP) to further specify stage 4 cancer, and lab values for CKD.Subjects: Decedents with cancer or CKD who had been admitted to an academic medical center in the last 6 months of life and died August 26, 2017-December 31, 2017.Main Measure: We calculated positive predictive values (PPV), false discovery rates (FDR), false negative rates (FNR), and sensitivity. Phenotypes were validated by a comparison with manual chart review. We also compared the EHR phenotype results to those admitted to the oncology and nephrology inpatient services.Key Results: The EHR phenotypes identified 271 decedents with cancer, of whom 186 had stage 4 disease; of 192 decedents with CKD, 89 had stage 4-5 disease. The EHR phenotype for stage 4 cancer had a PPV of 68.6%, FDR of 31.4%, FNR of 0.5%, and 99.5% sensitivity. The EHR phenotype for stage 4-5 CKD had a PPV of 46.4%, FDR of 53.7%, FNR of 0.0%, and 100% sensitivity.Conclusions: EHR phenotypes efficiently identified patients who died with late-stage cancer or CKD. Future EHR phenotypes can prioritize specificity over sensitivity, and incorporate stratification of high- and low-palliative care need. EHR phenotypes are a promising method for identifying patients for research and clinical purposes, including equitable distribution of specialty palliative care.

AB  - Objective: To examine the comparative effectiveness of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4), and sulfonylureas on risk of kidney outcomes among people with type 2 diabetes.Research Design and Methods: U.S. veterans initiated on SGLT2i (n = 18,544), GLP-1 (n = 23,711), DPP-4 (n = 39,399), or sulfonylureas (n = 134,904) were followed for up to 3 years to evaluate the risk of the composite outcome of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline >50%, end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), or all-cause mortality. Risks were estimated using survival models adjusted for predefined covariates as well as covariates identified by a high-dimensional variable selection algorithm through application of generalized propensity scores.Results: Compared with those treated with sulfonylureas, treatment with SGLT2i, GLP-1, and DPP-4 was associated with a lower risk of the composite outcome (hazard ratio 0.68 [95% CI 0.63, 0.74], 0.72 [0.67, 0.77], and 0.90 [0.86, 0.95], respectively). While we did not observe a statistically significant difference in risk between the SGLT2i and GLP-1 arms (0.95 [0.87, 1.04]), both SGLT2i and GLP-1 had a lower risk of the composite outcome than DPP-4 (0.76 [0.70, 0.82] and 0.79 [0.74, 0.85], respectively). Analyses by eGFR category suggested that compared with the sulfonylurea arm, those in the SGLT2i and GLP-1 arms exhibited a lower risk of the composite outcome in all eGFR categories, including eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2. Compared with DPP-4, both SGLT2i and GLP-1 exhibited a reduced risk of the composite outcome in eGFR <90 to ≥60, <60 to ≥45, and <45 mL/min/1.73 m2.Conclusions: In type 2 diabetes, treatment with SGLT2i or GLP-1 compared with DPP-4 or sulfonylureas was associated with a lower risk of adverse kidney outcomes.

AB  - Objective: To examine the comparative effectiveness of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) empagliflozin and other non-SGLT2i antihyperglycemics on the risk of major adverse kidney events (MAKE) of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline >50%, end-stage kidney disease, or all-cause mortality.Research Design and Methods: In a cohort study of 379,033 new users of empagliflozin or other non-SGLT2i antihyperglycemics, predefined variables and covariates identified by a high-dimensional variable selection algorithm were used to build propensity scores. Weighted survival analyses were then applied to estimate the risk of MAKE.Results: Compared with other antihyperglycemics, empagliflozin use was associated with 0.99 (95% CI 0.51, 1.55) mL/min/1.73 m2 less annual reduction in eGFR, 0.25 (95% CI 0.16, 0.33) kg/m2 more annual decrease in BMI, and reduced risk of MAKE (hazard ratio [HR] 0.68 [95% CI 0.64, 0.73]). Empagliflozin use was associated with reduced risk of MAKE in eGFR ≥90, ≥60 to <90, ≥45 to <60, and ≥30 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (HR 0.70 [95% CI 0.60, 0.82], 0.66 [0.60, 0.73], 0.78 [0.69, 0.89]), and 0.71 [0.55, 0.92], respectively), in participants without albuminuria, with microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria (HR 0.65 [95% CI 0.57, 0.75], 0.72 [0.66. 0.79], and 0.74 [0.62, 0.88], respectively), and in participants with and without cardiovascular disease (HR 0.67 [95% CI 0.61, 0.74] and 0.76 [0.69, 0.83], respectively). The association was evident in per-protocol analyses, which required continuation of the assigned antihyperglycemic medication (empagliflozin or other antihyperglycemics) during follow-up (HR 0.64 [95% CI 0.60, 0.70]), and in analyses requiring concurrent use of metformin in at least the first 90 days of follow-up (HR 0.63 [0.57-0.69]).Conclusions: Among people with type 2 diabetes, empagliflozin use was associated with eGFR preservation, a greater decline in BMI, and a reduced risk of MAKE compared with other non-SGLT2i antihyperglycemics.

AB  - Kidney transplantation is recommended for patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). However, complications, such as graft rejection are hard to predict due to donor and recipient variability. This study discusses the role of machine learning (ML) in predicting graft rejection following kidney transplantation, by reviewing the available related literature. PubMed, DBLP, and Scopus databases were searched to identify studies that utilized ML methods, in predicting outcome following kidney transplants. Fourteen studies were included. This study reviewed the deployment of ML in 109,317 kidney transplant patients from 14 studies. We extracted five different ML algorithms from reviewed studies. Decision Tree (DT) algorithms revealed slightly higher performance with overall mean Area Under the Curve (AUC) for DT (79.5% ± 0.06) was higher than Artificial Neural Network (ANN) (78.2% ± 0.08). For predicting graft rejection, ANN and DT were at the top among ML models that had higher accuracy and AUC.

AB  - Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a complex clinical entity associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Common comorbidities including hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, obesity, and increasing age predispose to preclinical diastolic dysfunction that often progresses to frank HFpEF. Clinical HFpEF is typically associated with some degree of diastolic dysfunction, but can occur in the absence of many conventional diastolic dysfunction indices. The exact biologic links between risk factors, structural changes, and clinical manifestations are not clearly apparent. Innovative approaches including deformation imaging have enabled deeper understanding of HFpEF cardiac mechanics beyond conventional metrics. Furthermore, predictive analytics through data‐driven platforms have allowed for a deeper understanding of HFpEF phenotypes. This review focuses on the changes in cardiac mechanics that occur through preclinical myocardial dysfunction to clinically apparent HFpEF.

AB  - Complications from vascular access are the leading cause of morbidity in the hemodialysis population. The use of tunneled catheters is associated with a greater risk of bacteremia and mortality when compared to other types of hemodialysis access. Infective endocarditis is a serious complication occurring in 2–5% of patients undergoing hemodialysis and is likely secondary to transient bacteremia from repetitive vascular access. Objective: To review outcomes in hemodialysis-dependent patients requiring cardiac valve replacement for infective endocarditis. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted to identify all patients who underwent valve replacement within a six-year period (January 2009–December 2014). Inclusion criteria included a diagnosis of infective endocarditis and end stage renal disease on hemodialysis. Relevant clinical information including demographics, comorbidities, valve involvement, causative organisms, and type of hemodialysis access (arteriovenous fistula, arteriovenous graft, or tunneled catheter) was collected. Results: A total of 1497 patients underwent cardiac valve replacement within the six-year period. Of these, 167 patients (11.2%) had infective endocarditis and 119 patients (7.9%) had end stage renal disease on hemodialysis. Overall 30-day mortality for valve replacement was 5.0% (75/1497). Mortality for patients with infective endocarditis was 7.2% (12/167) and for patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis was 10.1% (12/119). Thirty-three patients (2.2%) had infective endocarditis and end stage renal disease on hemodialysis. Of these, 12 patients were being dialyzed via arteriovenous fistula, 4 via arteriovenous graft, and 17 via tunneled catheter. Mortality occurred in 2 of 12 patients with arteriovenous fistula, 1 of 4 patients with arteriovenous graft, and 2 of 17 patients with tunneled catheter for an overall mortality of 15.2% (5/33). Conclusion: Infective endocarditis remains a significant problem in patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, particularly when tunneled catheters are utilized for hemodialysis access. Although appropriate algorithms have been developed to minimize long term use of tunneled catheters, bacteremia remains a significant problem. We reviewed our institutional experience and the medical literature to determine outcomes in hemodialysis-dependent patients with infective endocarditis requiring valve replacement. Despite mortality rates between 42 and 73% reported in the literature, our mortality rate was 15.2%. 1 Care of these critically ill patients must emphasize early diagnosis and aggressive management to optimize outcomes.

AB  - Aims: The primary objective of this systematic review was to estimate the prevalence and temporal changes in chronic comorbid conditions reported in heart failure (HF) clinical trials.Methods and Results: We searched MEDLINE for HF trials enrolling more than 400 patients published between 2001 and 2016.Trials were divided into HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), or trials enrolling regardless of ejection fraction. The prevalence of baseline chronic comorbid conditions was categorized according to the algorithm proposed by the Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse, which is used to analyse Medicare data. To test for a trend in the prevalence of comorbid conditions, linear regression models were used to evaluate temporal trends in prevalence of comorbidities. Overall, 118 clinical trials enrolling a cumulative total of 215 508 patients were included. Across all comorbidities examined, data were reported in a mean of 35% of trials, without significant improvement during the study period. Reporting of comorbidities was more common in HFrEF trials (51%) compared with HFpEF trials (27%). Among trials reporting data, hypertension (63%), ischaemic heart disease (44%), hyperlipidaemia (48%), diabetes (33%), chronic kidney disease (25%) and atrial fibrillation (25%) were the major comorbidities. The prevalence of comorbidities including hypertension, atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease increased over time while the prevalence of smoking decreased in HFrEF trials.Conclusion: Many HF trials do not report baseline comorbidities. A more rigorous, systematic, and standardized framework needs to be adopted for future clinical trials to ensure adequate comorbidity reporting and improve recruitment of multi-morbid HF patients.

AB  - In medical studies one frequently encounters ratio outcomes. For modeling these right-skewed positive variables, two approaches are in common use. The first one assumes that the outcome follows a normal distribution after transformation (e.g. a log-normal distribution), and the second one assumes gamma distributed outcome values. Classical regression approaches relate the mean ratio to a set of explanatory variables and treat the other parameters of the underlying distribution as nuisance parameters. Here, more flexible extensions for modeling ratio outcomes are proposed that allow to relate all the distribution parameters to explanatory variables. The models are embedded into the framework of generalized additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS), and can be fitted using a component-wise gradient boosting algorithm. The added value of the new modeling approach is demonstrated by the analysis of the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio, which is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events, using data from the German Chronic Kidney Disease Study. Particularly, our results confirm various important findings on risk factors for cardiovascular events.

AB  - Background: Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare infection with rapid deterioration and a high mortality rate. Factors associated with in-hospital mortality have not been thoroughly evaluated. Although predictive models identifying the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis have been described (such as the Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis [LRINEC]), their use in predicting mortality is limited.Questions/purposes: (1) What demographic factors are associated with in-hospital mortality in patients with necrotizing fasciitis? (2) What clinical factors are associated with in-hospital mortality? (3) What laboratory values are associated with in-hospital mortality? (4) Is the LRINEC score useful in predicting mortality?Methods: We retrospectively studied all patients with necrotizing fasciitis at our tertiary care institution during a 10-year period. In all, 134 patients were identified; after filtering out patients with missing data (seven) and those without histologically confirmed necrotizing fasciitis (12), 115 patients remained. These patients were treated with early-initiation antibiotic therapy and aggressive surgical intervention once the diagnosis was suspected. Demographic data, clinical features, laboratory results, and treatment variables were identified. The median age was 56 years and 42% of patients were female. Of the 115 patients analyzed, 15% (17) died in the hospital. Univariate and receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed due to the low number of mortality events seen in this cohort.Results: The demographic factors associated with in-hospital mortality were older age (median: 64 years for nonsurvivors [interquartile range (IQR) 57-79] versus 55 years for survivors [IQR 45-63]; p = 0.002), coronary artery disease (odds ratio 4.56 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.51 to 14]; p = 0.008), chronic kidney disease (OR 4.92 [95% CI 1.62 to 15]; p = 0.006), and transfer from an outside hospital (OR 3.47 [95% CI 1.19 to 10]; p = 0.02). The presenting clinical characteristics associated with in-hospital mortality were positive initial blood culture results (OR 4.76 [95% CI 1.59 to 15]; p = 0.01), lactic acidosis (OR 4.33 [95% CI 1.42 to 16]; p = 0.02), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (OR 6.37 [95% CI 2.05 to 20]; p = 0.002). Laboratory values at initial presentation that were associated with in-hospital mortality were platelet count (difference of medians -136 [95% CI -203 to -70]; p < 0.001), serum pH (difference of medians -0.13 [95% CI -0.21 to -0.03]; p = 0.02), serum lactate (difference of medians 0.90 [95% CI 0.40 to 4.80]; p < 0.001), serum creatinine (difference of medians 1.93 [95% CI 0.65 to 3.44]; p < 0.001), partial thromboplastin time (difference of medians 8.30 [95% CI 1.85 to 13]; p = 0.03), and international normalized ratio (difference of medians 0.1 [95% CI 0.0 to 0.5]; p = 0.004). The LRINEC score was a poor predictor of mortality with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.56 [95% CI 0.45-0.67].Conclusions: Factors aiding clinical recognition of necrotizing fasciitis are not consistently helpful in predicting mortality of this infection. Identifying patients with potentially compromised organ function should lead to aggressive and expedited measures for diagnosis and treatment. Future multicenter studies with larger populations and a standardized algorithm of treatment triggered by high clinical suspicion can be used to validate these findings to better help prognosticate this potentially fatal diagnosis.Level of Evidence Level III, therapeutic study.

AB  - Background: Sarcopenia, cachexia and frailty have overlapping features and clinical consequences, but often go unrecognized. The objective was to detect patients described by clinicians as having sarcopenia, cachexia or frailty within electronic health records (EHR) and compare clinical variables between cases and matched controls.Methods: We conducted a case-control study using retrospective data from the Indiana Network for Patient Care multi-health system database from 2016 to 2017. The computable phenotype combined ICD codes for sarcopenia, cachexia and frailty, with clinical note text terms for sarcopenia, cachexia and frailty detected using natural language processing. Cases with these codes or text terms were matched to controls without these codes or text terms matched on birth year, sex and race. Two physicians reviewed EHR for all cases and a subset of controls. Comorbidity codes, laboratory values, and other coded clinical variables were compared between groups using Wilcoxon matched-pair sign-rank test for continuous variables and conditional logistic regression for binary variables.Results: Cohorts of 9594 cases and 9594 matched controls were generated. Cases were 59% female, 69% white, and a median (1st, 3rd quartiles) age 74.9 (62.2, 84.8) years. Most cases were detected by text terms without ICD codes n = 8285 (86.4%). All cases detected by ICD codes (total n = 1309) also had supportive text terms. Overall 1496 (15.6%) had concurrent terms or codes for two or more of the three conditions (sarcopenia, cachexia or frailty). Of text term occurrence, 97% were used positively for sarcopenia, 90% for cachexia, and 95% for frailty. The remaining occurrences were negative uses of the terms or applied to someone other than the patient. Cases had lower body mass index, albumin and prealbumin, and significantly higher odds ratios for diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular and peripheral vascular diseases, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, malignancy, osteoporosis and fractures (all p < 0.05). Cases were more likely to be prescribed appetite stimulants and caloric supplements.Conclusions: Patients detected with a computable phenotype for sarcopenia, cachexia and frailty differed from controls in several important clinical variables. Potential uses include detection among clinical cohorts for targeting recruitment for research and interventions.

AB  - Diabetes is a metabolic disorder comprising of high glucose level in blood over a prolonged period in the body as it is not capable of using it properly. The severe complications associated with diabetes include diabetic ketoacidosis, nonketotic hypersmolar coma, cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic renal failure, retinal damage and foot ulcers. There is a huge increase in the number of patients with diabetes globally and it is considered a major health problem worldwide. Early diagnosis of diabetes is helpful for treatment and reduces the chance of severe complications associated with it. Machine learning algorithms (such as ANN, SVM, Naive Bayes, PLS-DA and deep learning) and data mining techniques are used for detecting interesting patterns for diagnosing and treatment of disease. Current computational methods for diabetes diagnosis have some limitations and are not tested on different datasets or peoples from different countries which limits the practical use of prediction methods. This paper is an effort to summarize the majority of the literature concerned with machine learning and data mining techniques applied for the prediction of diabetes and associated challenges. This report would be helpful for better prediction of disease and improve in understanding the pattern of diabetes. Consequently, the report would be helpful for treatment and reduce risk of other complications of diabetes.

AB  - This article is motivated by jointly modelling longitudinal and time-to-event clinical data of patients with diabetes and end-stage renal disease. All patients are on the waiting list for the pancreas transplant after kidney transplant, and some of them have a pancreas transplant before kidney transplant failure or death. Scant literature has studied the dynamical joint relationship of the estimated glomerular filtration rates trajectory, the effect of pancreas transplant, and time-to-event outcomes, although it remains an important clinical question. In an attempt to describe the association in the multiple outcomes, we propose a new joint model with a longitudinal submodel and an accelerated failure time submodel, which are linked by some latent variables. The accelerated failure time submodel is used to determine the relationship of the time-to-event outcome with all predictors. In addition, the piecewise linear function in the survival submodel is used to calculate the dynamic hazard ratio curve of a time-dependent side event, because the effect of the side event on the time-to-event outcome is non-proportional. The model parameters are estimated with a Monte Carlo EM algorithm. The finite sample performance of the proposed method is investigated in simulation studies. Our method is demonstrated by fitting the joint model for the clinical data of 13,635 patients with diabetes and the end-stage renal disease.

AB  - Importance: Typically defined as the top 5% of health care users, super-utilizers are responsible for an estimated 40% to 55% of all health care costs. Little is known about which factors may be associated with increased risk of long-term postoperative super-utilization.Objective: To identify clusters of patients with distinct constellations of clinical and comorbid patterns who may be associated with an elevated risk of super-utilization in the year following elective surgery.Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective longitudinal cohort study of 1 049 160 patients who underwent abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, coronary artery bypass graft, colectomy, total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, or lung resection were identified from the 100% Medicare inpatient and outpatient Standard Analytic Files at all inpatient facilities performing 1 or more of the evaluated surgical procedures from 2013 to 2015. Data from 2012 to 2016 were used to evaluate expenditures in the year preceding and following surgery. Using a machine learning approach known as Logic Forest, comorbidities and interactions of comorbidities that put patients at an increased chance of becoming a super-utilizer were identified. All comorbidities, as defined by the Charlson (range, 0-24) and Elixhauser (range, 0-29) comorbidity indices, were used in the analysis. Higher scores indicated higher comorbidity burden. Data analysis was completed on November 16, 2018.Main Outcome and Measures: Super-utilization of health care in the year following surgery.Results: In total, 1 049 160 patients met inclusion criteria and were included in the analytic cohort. Their median (interquartile range) age was 73 (69-78) years, and approximately 40% were male. Super-utilizers comprised 4.8% of the overall cohort (n = 79 746) yet incurred 31.7% of the expenditures. Although the difference in overall expenditures per person between super-utilizers ($4049) and low users ($2148) was relatively modest prior to surgery, the difference in expenditures between super-utilizers ($79 698) vs low users ($2977) was marked in the year following surgery. Risk factors associated with super-utilization of health care included hemiplegia/paraplegia (odds ratio, 5.2; 95% CI, 4.4-6.2), weight loss (odds ratio, 3.5; 95% CI, 2.9-4.2), and congestive heart failure with chronic kidney disease stages I to IV (odds ratio, 3.4; 95% CI, 3.0-3.9).Conclusions and Relevance: Super-utilizers comprised only a small fraction of the surgical population yet were responsible for a disproportionate amount of Medicare expenditure. Certain subpopulations were associated with super-utilization of health care following surgical intervention despite having lower overall use in the preoperative period.

AB  - Background: Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are associated with increased risks for cardiovascular disease later in life. The HDP incidence is commonly assessed using diagnostic codes, which are not reliable; and typically are expressed per-pregnancy, which may underestimate the number of women with an HDP history after their reproductive years.Objectives: This study sought to determine the incidence of HDP expressed as both per-pregnancy and per-woman, and to establish their associations with future chronic conditions and multimorbidity, a measure of accelerated aging, in a population-based cohort study.Methods: Using the Rochester Epidemiology Project medical record-linkage system, the authors identified residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, who delivered between 1976 and 1982. The authors classified pregnancies into normotensive, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, pre-eclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension, and chronic hypertension using a validated electronic algorithm, and calculated the incidence of HDP both per-pregnancy and per-woman. The risk of chronic conditions between women with versus those without a history of HDP (age and parity 1:2 matched) was quantified using the hazard ratio and corresponding 95% confidence interval estimated from a Cox model.Results: Among 9,862 pregnancies, we identified 719 (7.3%) with HDP and 324 (3.3%) with pre-eclampsia. The incidence of HDP and pre-eclampsia doubled when assessed on a per-woman basis: 15.3% (281 of 1,839) and 7.5% (138 of 1,839), respectively. Women with a history of HDP were at increased risk for subsequent diagnoses of stroke (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.27; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.37 to 3.76), coronary artery disease (HR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.26 to 2.82), cardiac arrhythmias (HR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.28 to 2.05), chronic kidney disease (HR: 2.41; 95% CI: 1.54 to 3.78), and multimorbidity (HR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.35).Conclusions: The HDP population-based incidence expressed per-pregnancy underestimates the number of women affected by this condition during their reproductive years. A history of HDP confers significant increase in risks for future chronic conditions and multimorbidity.

AB  - Background: The measurement of monoclonal free light chains is being increasingly utilized since the introduction of serum-based assays. It is important for laboratories to determine their own reference ranges in order to reflect the local population. The aim of this study was to determine if age-adjusted reference ranges for serum free light chains would have implications for demand management of further laboratory investigations including immunofixation. Methods: After certain exclusions, 4293 samples from individuals seen in primary care across Oxfordshire between 2014 and 2016 were identified for analysis of patient characteristics, serum free light chain results and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Results: We found age to be an independent variable when considering serum free light chain concentrations, ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate. The reference ranges derived from our data differ markedly from the original Binding Site ranges. When the age-specific ranges are retrospectively applied to our population, there is a 38% decrease in follow-up testing with no loss of specificity. Conclusion: We feel confident implementing new age-specific serum free light chain reference ranges in our laboratory. We have developed a simple algorithm for evaluating serum free light chains based on age and estimated glomerular filtration rate. We encourage laboratories to establish their own local reference ranges using large cohorts and their chosen serum free light chain assay platform.

AB  - Hypertensive emergency can cause thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in the kidneys with high rates of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and vice versa. The conundrum of hypertension as the cause of TMA or consequence of TMA on the background of defects in complement regulation remains difficult. Patients with hypertensive emergency and TMA on kidney biopsy were tested for ex vivo C5b9 formation on the endothelium and rare variants in complement genes to identify complement-mediated TMA. We identified factors associated with defects in complement regulation and poor renal outcomes. Massive ex vivo C5b9 formation was found on resting endothelial cells in 18 (69%) out of 26 cases at the presentation, including the 9 patients who carried at least one rare genetic variant. Thirteen (72%, N=18) and 3 (38%, N=8) patients with massive and normal ex vivo complement activation, respectively, progressed to ESRD (P=0.03). In contrast to BP control, inhibition of C5 activation prevented ESRD to occur in 5 (83%, N=6) patients with massive ex vivo complement activation. TMA-related graft failure occurred in 7 (47%, N=15) donor kidneys and was linked to genetic variants. The assessment of both ex vivo C5b9 formation and screening for rare variants in complement genes may categorize patients with hypertensive emergency and TMA into different groups with potential therapeutic and prognostic implications. We propose an algorithm to recognize patients at the highest risk for defects in complement regulation.

AB  - Background Patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) are at high risk of myocardial infarction. Cardiac troponins are the biomarkers of choice for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) without ST -segment elevation ( NSTE ). In patients with CKD , troponin levels are often chronically elevated, which reduces their diagnostic utility when NSTE - AMI is suspected. The aim of this study was to derive a diagnostic algorithm for serial troponin measurements in patients with CKD and suspected NSTE - AMI . Methods and Results Two cohorts, 1494 patients from a prospective cohort study with high-sensitivity troponin I (hs- cTnI ) measurements and 7059 cases from a clinical registry with high-sensitivity troponin T (hs- cTnT ) measurements, were analyzed. The prospective cohort comprised 280 CKD patients (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2). The registry data set contained 1581 CKD patients. In both cohorts, CKD patients were more likely to have adjudicated NSTE - AMI than non- CKD patients. The specificities of hs- cTnI and hs- cTnT to detect NSTE - AMI were reduced with CKD (0.82 versus 0.91 for hs- cTnI and 0.26 versus 0.73 for hs- cTnT ) but could be restored by applying optimized cutoffs to either the first or a second measurement after 3 hours. The best diagnostic performance was achieved with an algorithm that incorporates serial measurements and rules in or out AMI in 69% (hs- cTnI ) and 55% (hs- cTnT ) of CKD patients. Conclusions The diagnostic performance of high-sensitivity cardiac troponins in patients with CKD with suspected NSTE - AMI is improved by use of an algorithm based on admission troponin and dynamic changes in troponin concentration.

AB  - Background: Kidney transplantation (KT) is the most obvious method of treating a patient with end-stage renal disease. In the early stages of KT, urine production is considered a marker of successful reperfusion of the kidney after anastomosis. However, there is no clear conclusion about the relationship between initial urine output after KT and 1-year renal function. Thus, we investigated the factors that affect 1-year kidney function after KT, including urine output. Methods: This retrospective study investigated the relationship between urine output in the 3 days after KT and transplanted kidney prognosis after 1-year. In total, 291 patients (129 living-donor and 162 deceased-donor transplant recipients) were analyzed; 24-h urine volume per body weight (in kilograms) was measured for 3 days postoperatively. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), determined by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease algorithm, was used as an index of renal function. Patients were grouped according to eGFR at 1-year after KT: a good residual function group, eGFR ≥60, and a poor residual function group, eGFR < 60. Result: Recipients' factors affecting 1-year eGFR include height (P = 0.03), weight (P = 0.00), and body mass index (P = 0.00). Donor factors affecting 1-year eGFR include age (P = 0.00) and number of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatches (P = 0.00). The urine output for 3 days after KT (postoperative day 1; 2 and 3) was associated with 1-year eGFR in deceased-donor (P = 0.00; P = 0.00 and P = 0.01). And, postoperative urine output was associated with the occurrence of delayed graft function (area under curve (AUC) = 0.913; AUC = 0.984 and AUC = 0.944). Conclusion: Although postoperative urine output alone is not enough to predict 1-year GFR, the incidence of delayed graft function can be predicted. Also, the appropriate urine output after KT may differ depending on the type of the transplanted kidney.

AB  - Background: Enarodustat (JTZ-951) is an oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor that mimics adaptive responses to hypoxic conditions and may provide a new therapeutic approach for managing anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We evaluated the efficacy, safety, and maintenance dose of enarodustat in anemic patients with CKD not on dialysis.Methods: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) naïve patients (correction group) and patients on a stable dose of ESA (conversion group) were randomized to receive 2, 4, or 6 mg of enarodustat or placebo once daily for 6 weeks in a double-blind manner (Period 1) followed by 24 weeks of open enarodustat treatment to maintain their hemoglobin (Hb) levels within a target range of 10.0-12.0 g/dL in reference to a dose adjustment algorithm (Period 2).Results: In the correction group, Hb level increase rate per week increased in a dose-response manner. The proportion of subjects in the conversion group who maintained Hb levels within ± 1.0 g/dL of baseline did not differ between each enarodustat arm and placebo arm during Period 1. Over 70% of subjects in both groups maintained Hb levels within the target range at the end of treatment in Period 2. The mean prescribed doses were 3.58 and 3.74 mg/day in the correction group and the conversion group, respectively. Enarodustat was associated with decreases in hepcidin and ferritin and increased total iron-binding capacity and was generally well tolerated.Conclusions: Enarodustat corrects and maintains Hb levels in anemic patients with CKD not on dialysis.

AB  - Background Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria outbreaks represent a major threat in intensive care units. Patients may then be exposed to drug-related direct toxicity during such outbreaks. The objective of this study was to explore the impact of an outbreak of imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (IR-AB) on renal outcomes. Methods We performed a before-and-after observational study in a French burn intensive care unit during an IR-AB outbreak: a 13-month period before (period A, October 2013-October 2014) and a 13-month period after outbreak control (period B, December 2014-December 2015). A total of 409 patients were included, 195 during period A and 214 during period B. The main endpoint was major adverse kidney events at day 90 (MAKE 90). Secondary endpoints were acute kidney injury (AKI) and persistent renal dysfunction. Results Incidence of MAKE 90 was 15.9% during period A versus 11.2% during period B (P =.166) and AKI 28.2% versus 18.7% (P =.023). The use of colistin was associated with renal outcomes in univariate analysis. After adjustment of potential confounding factors using a targeted Machine Learning Analysis (ie, IR-AB-related infection, septic shock, severity scores, other nephrotoxics, chronic kidney disease, serum creatinine at admission, Staphylococcus aureus), colistin remained associated with the risk of MAKE and AKI (relative risk = 2.909, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.364, 6.204], P =.006 for MAKE 90, and relative risk = 2.14, 95% CI [1.52, 3.02], P <.0001 for AKI). Conclusions The episode of IR-AB outbreak was associated with an increased risk of kidney events, which appears to be driven by the use of colistin.

AB  - Objectives: To develop algorithms mapping the Kidney Disease Quality of Life 36-Item Short Form Survey (KDQOL-36) onto the 3-level EQ-5D questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) and the 5-level EQ-5D questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) for patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis.Methods: We used data from a cross-sectional study in Europe (France, n = 299; Germany, n = 413; Italy, n = 278; Spain, n = 225) to map onto EQ-5D-3L and data from a cross-sectional study in Singapore (n = 163) to map onto EQ-5D-5L. Direct mapping using linear regression, mixture beta regression and adjusted limited dependent variable mixture models (ALDVMMs) and response mapping using seemingly unrelated ordered probit models were performed. The KDQOL-36 subscale scores, i.e., physical component summary (PCS), mental component summary (MCS), three disease-specific subscales or their average, i.e., kidney disease component summary (KDCS), and age and sex were included as the explanatory variables. Predictive performance was assessed by mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) using 10-fold cross-validation.Results: Mixture models outperformed linear regression and response mapping. When mapping to EQ-5D-3L, the ALDVMM model was the best-performing one for France, Germany and Spain while beta regression was best for Italy. When mapping to EQ-5D-5L, the ALDVMM model also demonstrated the best predictive performance. Generally, models using KDQOL-36 subscale scores showed better fit than using the KDCS.Conclusions: This study adds to the growing literature suggesting the better performance of the mixture models in modelling EQ-5D and produces algorithms to map the KDQOL-36 onto EQ-5D-3L (for France, Germany, Italy, and Spain) and EQ-5D-5L (for Singapore).

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is recognized as a leading public health problem and causes numerous health complications. One of the most common and burdensome dermatological symptoms affecting patients undergoing dialysis is CKD-associated pruritus (CKD-aP). This condition not only has a negative impact on sleep, mood, daily activities, and quality of life but also increases the mortality risk of hemodialyzed patients. Despite that, this condition is greatly underestimated in clinical practice. Due to the complex and still not fully understood etiopathogenesis of CKD-aP, the choice of an effective therapy remains a challenge for clinicians. Most common therapeutic algorithms use topical treatment, phototherapy, and various systemic approaches. This review aimed to summarize most recent theories about the pathogenesis, clinical features, and treatment of CKD-aP.

AB  - Restricted mean survival time (RMST) has gained increased attention in biostatistical and clinical studies. Directly modeling RMST (as opposed to modeling then transforming the hazard function) is appealing computationally and in terms of interpreting covariate effects. We propose computationally convenient methods for evaluating center effects based on RMST. A multiplicative model for the RMST is assumed. Estimation proceeds through an algorithm analogous to stratification, which permits the evaluation of thousands of centers. We derive the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and evaluate finite sample performance through simulation. We demonstrate that considerable decreases in computational burden are achievable through the proposed methods, in terms of both storage requirements and run time. The methods are applied to evaluate more than 5000 US dialysis facilities using data from a national end-stage renal disease registry.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: We will summarize recent epidemiological observations on the risk for overt diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in nonproteinuric patients, will focus on novel studies based on a proteomic biomarker of DKD and will discuss the possibility of preventing the progression of DKD in nonproteinuric patients by sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.Recent Findings: Although less frequently than in type 2 diabetes, DKD may develop also in nonproteinuric type 1 diabetes. However, the progression rate to kidney failure in nonproteinuric diabetic people is much lower than in proteinuric ones. A new proteomic biomarker, the chronic kidney disease (CKD)273, reliably predicts the risk of incident micro and macroalbuminuria and of CKD in nonalbuminuric diabetic people. SGLT2 inhibition markedly reduces albuminuria in macro and microalbuminuric patients and discernibly mitigates albumin excretion also in those with albuminuria in the normal range.Summary: Studies focusing on risk factors for DKD in nonproteinuric patients are a clinical research priority. The CKD273 classifier is a promising biomarker for the early identification of nonproteinuric patients at high risk for progressive DKD. Empagliflozin and SGLT2 inhibitors may have a favorable impact on the progression of DKD in nonalbuminuric diabetic people, a hypothesis to be tested in specific clinical trials.

AB  - Objectives: To develop an acute kidney injury risk prediction model using electronic health record data for longitudinal use in hospitalized patients.Design: Observational cohort study.Setting: Tertiary, urban, academic medical center from November 2008 to January 2016.Patients: All adult inpatients without pre-existing renal failure at admission, defined as first serum creatinine greater than or equal to 3.0 mg/dL, International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition, code for chronic kidney disease stage 4 or higher or having received renal replacement therapy within 48 hours of first serum creatinine measurement.Interventions: None.Measurements and Main Results: Demographics, vital signs, diagnostics, and interventions were used in a Gradient Boosting Machine algorithm to predict serum creatinine-based Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes stage 2 acute kidney injury, with 60% of the data used for derivation and 40% for validation. Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated in the validation cohort, and subgroup analyses were conducted across admission serum creatinine, acute kidney injury severity, and hospital location. Among the 121,158 included patients, 17,482 (14.4%) developed any Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes acute kidney injury, with 4,251 (3.5%) developing stage 2. The AUC (95% CI) was 0.90 (0.90-0.90) for predicting stage 2 acute kidney injury within 24 hours and 0.87 (0.87-0.87) within 48 hours. The AUC was 0.96 (0.96-0.96) for receipt of renal replacement therapy (n = 821) in the next 48 hours. Accuracy was similar across hospital settings (ICU, wards, and emergency department) and admitting serum creatinine groupings. At a probability threshold of greater than or equal to 0.022, the algorithm had a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 85% for stage 2 acute kidney injury and predicted the development of stage 2 a median of 41 hours (interquartile range, 12-141 hr) prior to the development of stage 2 acute kidney injury.Conclusions: Readily available electronic health record data can be used to predict impending acute kidney injury prior to changes in serum creatinine with excellent accuracy across different patient locations and admission serum creatinine. Real-time use of this model would allow early interventions for those at high risk of acute kidney injury.

AB  - Diabetic muscle infarction (DMI) is one of the unusual complications of poorly controlled diabetes. It is usually seen in association with other microvascular complications. This condition is reported rarely, probably due to it's under recognition. It is also seen in patients with chronic kidney disease and should be considered in patients presenting with acute onset of limb pain. Here we present two cases of DMI in dialysis patients and discuss the available literature to highlight the clinical characteristics of the cases. We also present a diagnostic algorithm to discuss evaluation of dialysis patients presenting with limb pain.

AB  - Background: For patients with anemia undergoing hemodialysis, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are typically dosed via precise algorithms. Using one such algorithm, we assessed the maintenance of hemoglobin levels in patients switched from epoetin alfa reference product (Epogen®) to epoetin alfa-epbx (RetacritTM; a biosimilar to US-licensed Epogen®/Procrit®).Methods: This randomized, open-label, non-inferiority study was conducted at Fresenius Medical Care North America (FMCNA) hemodialysis centers. Patients with anemia and chronic kidney disease undergoing maintenance hemodialysis and receiving routine intravenous (IV) Epogen® were randomized 1: 1 to switch to IV RetacritTM or continue standard-of-care (Epogen®) for 24 weeks, using analogous versions of the FMCNA ESA-dosing algorithm. The primary endpoint was the proportion of time patients' hemoglobin was 9-11 g/dL during weeks 17-24.Results: Of 432 randomized patients, 418 received treatment (RetacritTM, n = 212; standard-of-care, n = 206) and comprised the full analysis set. A similar proportion of patients discontinued from each arm. The proportion of time patients' hemoglobin was within the target range was 61.9% (95% CI 57.5-66.2) in the RetacritTM arm and 63.3% (95% CI 58.7-67.7) in the standard-of-care arm. The difference in proportions between treatment arms was -1.4% (95% CI -7.6 to 4.9), and the lower bound of the confidence interval was within the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -12.5%. There was no statistically significant difference between arms in the mean change from baseline in the weekly mean ESA dose during weeks 17-24, and no clinically relevant differences in safety outcomes.Conclusions: Switching to RetacritTM was non-inferior to continuing -Epogen® in maintaining hemoglobin levels in patients receiving hemodialysis, when both ESAs were dosed using a specified algorithm (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02504294).

This study was to explore the relationship between cardiac troponin T (cTnT) levels and the extent of coronary plaque burden, as assessed by CCTA in those with HIV infection. Between June and September 2017, 58 HIV-infected participants were recruited and underwent contrast-enhanced CCTA. cTnT was measured with the Elecsys Troponin T Gen 5 STAT assay, and noncalcified plaque burden was quantified using coronary plaque analysis. Robust regression model was employed to perform primary statistical analysis. Univariate robust regression analysis indicated that male gender, cardiovascular risk score defined by the 2013 ACC/AHA cardiovascular risk score algorithm, and cTnT levels were significantly associated with noncalcified plaque volume index (NCPI). Final robust regression analyses showed that only cTnT (log scale) was independently associated with the NCPI (regression coefficient: 0.0453 with 95% CI: 0.0151, 0.0755, p = 0.003). These results of this study suggest that cTnT may be a promising marker for coronary plaque burden, especially in patients with HIV-associated CKD or without IV access.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Liquorice is the root of Glycyrrhiza glabra, which is a popular food in Europe and China that has previously shown benefits for skeletal fatigue and nutrient metabolism. However, the mechanism and active ingredients remain largely unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the active ingredients of liquorice for muscle wasting and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.Experimental Approach: RNA-Seq and bioinformatics analysis were applied to predict the main target of liquorice. A machine learning model and a docking tool were used to predict active ingredients. Isotope labelling experiments, immunostaining, Western blots, qRT-PCR, ChIP-PCR and luciferase reporters were utilized to test the pharmacological effects in vitro and in vivo. The reverse effects were verified through recombination-based overexpression.Key Results: The liposoluble constituents of liquorice improved muscle wasting by inhibiting protein catabolism and fibre atrophy. We further identified FoxO1 as the target of liposoluble constituents of liquorice. In addition, hispaglabridin B (HB) was predicted as an inhibitor of FoxO1. Further studies determined that HB improved muscle wasting by inhibiting catabolism in vivo and in vitro. HB also markedly suppressed the transcriptional activity of FoxO1, with decreased expression of the muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases MuRF1 and Atrogin-1.Conclusions and Implications: HB can serve as a novel natural food extract for preventing muscle wasting in chronic kidney disease and possibly other catabolic conditions.

AB  - Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience and is the most common symptom experienced by renal patients. It can be caused by primary co-morbid diseases, renal replacement therapies, medication or treatment side effects, and its intensity varies from moderate to severe. Pain management in renal patients is difficult, since the distance between pain relief and toxicity is very small. This paper will provide an algorithm for pain management proposed using paracetamol, nonsteroid anti-inflamatory drugs (NSAIDs), mild and stronger opioids as well as complementary techniques. Quality of Life (QoL) and overall enhancement of the patient experience through better pain management are also discussed. To improve pain management it is essential that nurses recognise that they have direct responsibilities related to pain assessment and tailoring of opioid analgesics and better and more detailed education.

AB  - End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the final stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and requires hemodialysis (HD) for survival. Intradialytic blood pressure (IBP) measurements are necessary to ensure patient safety during HD treatments and have critical clinical and prognostic significance. Studies on IBP measurements, especially IBP patterns, are limited. All related studies have been based on a priori knowledge and artificially classified IBP patterns. Therefore, the results were influenced by subjective concepts. In this study, we proposed a new approach to identify IBP patterns to classify ESRD patients. We used the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm to measure the similarity between two series of IBP data. Five blood pressure (BP) patterns were identified by applying the density peak clustering algorithm (DPCA) to the IBP data. To illustrate the association between BP patterns and prognosis, we constructed three random survival forest (RSF) models with different covariates. Model accuracy was improved 3.7-6.3% by the inclusion of BP patterns. The results suggest that BP patterns have critical clinical and prognostic significance regarding the risk of cerebrovascular events. We can also apply this clustering approach to other time series data from electronic health records (EHRs). This work is generalizable to analyses of dense EHR data.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the chronological patterns of diseases in Northern Gyeonggi-do province, South Korea, and compare these with national data. Methods: A National Health Insurance cohort based on the National Health Information Database (NHID Cohort 2002-2013) was used to perform a retrospective, population-based study (46,605,433 of the target population, of which 1,025,340 were randomly sampled) to identify disease patterns from 2002 to 2013. Common diseases including malaria, cancer (uterine cervix, urinary bladder, colon), diabetes mellitus, psychiatric disorders, hypertension, intracranial hemorrhage, bronchitis/bronchiolitis, peptic ulcer, and end stage renal disease were evaluated. Results: Uterine cervix cancer, urinary bladder cancer and colon cancer had the greatest rate of increase in Northern Gyeonggi-do province compared with the rest of the country, but by 2013 the incidence of these cancers had dropped dramatically. Acute myocardial infarction and end stage renal disease also increased over the study period. Psychiatric disorders, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and peptic ulcers showed a gradual increase over time. No obvious differences were found for intracranial hemorrhage or bronchitis/bronchiolitis between the Northern Gyeonggi-do province and the remaining South Korean provinces. Malaria showed a unique time trend, only observed in the Northern Gyeonggi province, peaking in 2004, 2007 and 2009 to 2010. Conclusion: This study showed that the Northern Gyeonggi-do province population had a different disease profile over time, compared with collated data for the remaining provinces in South Korea. “Big data” studies using the National Health Insurance cohort database can provide insight into the healthcare environment for healthcare providers, stakeholders and policymakers.

AB  - Background: The development of acute kidney injury (AKI) during an intensive care unit (ICU) admission is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.Methods: Our objective was to develop and validate a data driven multivariable clinical predictive model for early detection of AKI among a large cohort of adult critical care patients. We utilized data form the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) for all patients who had a creatinine measured for 3 days following ICU admission and excluded patients with pre-existing condition of Chronic Kidney Disease and Acute Kidney Injury on admission. Data extracted included patient age, gender, ethnicity, creatinine, other vital signs and lab values during the first day of ICU admission, whether the patient was mechanically ventilated during the first day of ICU admission, and the hourly rate of urine output during the first day of ICU admission.Results: Utilizing the demographics, the clinical data and the laboratory test measurements from Day 1 of ICU admission, we accurately predicted max serum creatinine level during Day 2 and Day 3 with a root mean square error of 0.224 mg/dL. We demonstrated that using machine learning models (multivariate logistic regression, random forest and artificial neural networks) with demographics and physiologic features can predict AKI onset as defined by the current clinical guideline with a competitive AUC (mean AUC 0.783 by our all-feature, logistic-regression model), while previous models aimed at more specific patient cohorts.Conclusions: Experimental results suggest that our model has the potential to assist clinicians in identifying patients at greater risk of new onset of AKI in critical care setting. Prospective trials with independent model training and external validation cohorts are needed to further evaluate the clinical utility of this approach and potentially instituting interventions to decrease the likelihood of developing AKI.

AB  - The bioimpedance spectroscopic (BIS) analytical algorithm described in this report allows for the non-invasive measurement of intravascular, interstitial, and intracellular volume changes during various fluid management procedures. The purpose of this study was to test clinical use feasibility and to demonstrate the validity of the BIS algorithm in computing compartmental volume shifts in human subjects undergoing fluid management treatment. Validation was performed using volume changes recorded from 20 end stage renal disease patients. The validation procedure involved mathematically deriving post hoc hematocrit profiles from the BIS data-generated fluid redistribution time profiles. These derived hematocrit profiles were then compared to serial hematocrit values measured simultaneously by a CritLine(®) monitor during 60 routine hemodialysis sessions. Regression and Bland-Altman analyses confirm that the BIS algorithm can be used to reliably derive the continuous and real-time rates of change of the compartmental fluid volumes. Regression results yielded a R (2) > 0.99 between the two measures of hematocrit at different times during dialysis. The slopes of the regression equations at the different times were nearly identical, demonstrating an almost one-to-one correspondence between the BIS and CritLine(®) hematocrits. Bland-Altman analysis show that the BIS algorithm can be used interchangeably with the CritLine(®) monitor for the measurement of hematocrit. The present study demonstrates for the first time that BIS can provide real-time continuous measurements of compartmental intravascular, interstitial and intracellular fluid volume changes during fluid management procedures when used in conjunction with this new algorithm.

AB  - Introduction: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are over-prescribed and prescribed inappropriately in the older population and have the potential for long-term adverse effects e.g. increased fracture risk, C. difficile infection, chronic kidney disease and drug interactions (1). Hospitalisation of older patients presents an opportunity for review of the PPI indication and potential for deprescribing. Aim: The study aimed to assess the feasibility of a pharmacist led intervention to deprescribe inappropriately prescribed PPIs in patients ≥65 years in an Irish teaching hospital. Methods: A multi-component feasibility intervention consisting of an education session for the medical team, followed by pharmacist-led screening of patients for potential PPI deprescribing, was conducted. The education session was delivered by the pharmacist to a geriatric medical team and the content outlined the prevalence of PPI prescribing, potential long-term effects of PPIs, and implementation of a PPI deprescribing algorithm. Over an eight-week period (May-June 2021), new admissions to the geriatric team were screened daily by the pharmacist and PPI prescribing patterns and indications were recorded. Patients ≥65 years were reviewed for PPI appropriateness based on their medical history and use of a PPI deprescribing algorithm (2). If the PPI was eligible for deprescribing (i.e. dose reduction or discontinuation) this was discussed with the geriatric team and the patient's primary care general practitioner (GP) and the patient. Patients were counselled and educated on this by the pharmacist. Patients whose PPI was deprescribed were followed up at 4- and 12- weeks post deprescribing to assess their symptoms and satisfaction with deprescribing in the interim period. An online survey was sent to the geriatric team doctors evaluating their views on the study process and implementation of PPI deprescribing in practice; data was analysed descriptively using Microsoft Excel®. Written, informed consent was obtained from all patients and doctors involved. Results: Of a total of 133 patient charts reviewed over the 8-week period, 94 patients were prescribed a PPI, with esomeprazole 40mg (43/94, 45.7%) being most commonly prescribed PPI, followed by pantoprazole 40mg (17/94, 18.1%). PPIs were inappropriately prescribed as per the indication in 36 cases (36/94, 38.3%). Following GP and Geriatric team discussion, 7/94 (7.4%) of patients were eligible for deprescribing, of which 5 had their PPI dose reduced (5/94, 5.3%). One patient declined the deprescribing, in another case the GP declined the deprescribing recommendation. The 5 patients deprescribed had their esomeprazole 40mg daily dose reduced to 20mg daily. This was sustained at the 12-week follow up and patients reported satisfaction with the change with no negative outcomes reported. Of the 12 geriatric doctors in the study, 6 completed the online survey. The majority reported barriers to PPI deprescribing being uncertainty regarding the indication (5/6) and being unable to monitor the patient after hospital discharge (5/6). All doctors agreed that pharmacists have a positive role to play in implementing PPI deprescribing. Conclusion: This study found that esomeprazole 40mg daily was the most commonly prescribing PPI in this hospital cohort, with the majority of PPI prescribing found to be inappropriate according to the indication. The feasibility study resulted in a number of patients having their PPI safely deprescribed with a dose reduction. Despite the limitation of a small sample size and small rates of deprescribing, a strength of the study was that a pharmacist led PPI deprescribing initiative resulted in reducing inappropriate PPI prescribing in older patients, with positive engagement from the geriatric medical team. Further resources and research are required to implement this initiative on a wider scale. References: (1) Wilsdon TD, Hendrix I, Thynne TR, Mangoni AA.

AB  - Consistent with the increase of precision medicine, the care of patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) requiring maintenance dialysis therapy should evolve to become more personalized. Precise and personalized care is nuanced and informed by a number of factors including an individual's needs and preferences, disease progression, and response to and tolerance of treatments. Technology can support the delivery of more precise and personalized care through multiple mechanisms, including more accurate and real-time assessments of key care elements, enhanced treatment monitoring, and remote monitoring of home dialysis therapies. Data from health care and non-health care sources and advanced analytical methods such as machine learning can be used to create novel insights, and large volumes of data can be integrated to support clinical decisions. Health care models continue to evolve and the opportunities and need for novel care approaches supported by technology and health informatics continue to expand as the delivery and organization of health care changes. Ultimately, precise personalized care for ESKD, including dialysis therapy, will become more feasible as the biological, social, and environmental determinants of health are more broadly understood and as advances in science, engineering, and information management create the means to provide truly precise care for ESKD.

AB  - Substantial progress has been made in the application of computer-driven methods to provide erythropoietic dosing information for patients with anemia resulting from chronic kidney disease. Initial solutions were simply computerized versions of traditional paper-based anemia management protocols. True personalization was achieved through the use of advanced modeling techniques such as artificial neural networks, physiologic models, and feedback control systems. The superiority of any one technique over another has not been determined, but all methods have shown an advantage in at least one area over the traditional paper expert system used by most dialysis facilities. Improvements in the percentage of hemoglobin measurements within target range, decreased within-subject hemoglobin variability, decreased erythropoiesis-stimulating agent dose, and decreased transfusion rates all have been shown.

AB  - AIM: There is limited data regarding the impact on hospital resource use of a dedicated, nurse-managed anemia clinic in patients with pre-end stage chronic kidney disease. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted comparing patients with pre-end stage anemia of chronic kidney disease enrolled in an algorithmic anemia clinic (N = 27, treatment group) with un-enrolled patients with chronic kidney disease (N = 22, control group). The treatment group received algorithmic treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin and intravenous iron sucrose, while controls received usual care. The primary outcomes investigated were emergency room visits and hospitalizations during a 1-year period. RESULTS: The two groups were similar at baseline. During the first year of clinic enrollment, the mean hemoglobin values improved in the treatment group from baseline and compared with controls (11.6 +/- 1.2 g/dl vs. 10.3 +/- 1.0 g/dl, p < 0.05). The relative risk of an emergency room visit (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.05-0.67, p < 0.05) and hospitalization (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.06-0.67, p < 0.05) were reduced in the treatment group versus the control group. The average length of hospital stay was also reduced (6.8 days vs. 9.5 days, p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Enrollment in a dedicated nurse-managed anemia clinic is significantly associated with reduced emergency room visits and hospitalizations in patients with pre-end stage CKD. These associative findings justify future prospective analyses to establish causality.

AB  - Baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) is approved for the treatment of resistant hypertension. In addition to blood pressure (BP) reduction, pilot studies suggested several organoprotective effects of BAT. Thirty-two patients with resistant hypertension were prospectively treated with BAT. Besides office BP and 24-hour ambulatory BP (ABP) measurements, detection of a urinary proteome-based classifier (CKD273), which has been shown to predict chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, was carried out at baseline and after 6 months of BAT. Office BP significantly decreased from 170 ± 25/90 ± 18 to 149 ± 29/82 ± 18 mm Hg. Analysis of CKD273 score and eGFR with CKD-EPI equation at baseline revealed strong correlation (r = 0.568, P < 0.001). After 6 months of BAT, there was no significant change in CKD273 score (-0.061 [95% CI: -0.262 to 0.140], P = 0.601). However, by stratification of the data regarding ABP response, there was a statistically significant (P = 0.0113) reduction in the CKD273 score from a mean of 0.161 [95% CI: -0.093 to 0.414] to -0.346 [95% CI: -0.632 to -0.060] after BAT in patients with systolic ABP decrease of ≥5 mm Hg. These data emphasized potential nephroprotective effects of BAT in patients with sufficient BP response.

AB  - Importance: Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis are eligible for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) if the 30-day surgical complication rate is less than 3% and the patient's life expectancy is at least 5 years.Objective: To develop a risk prediction tool to improve patient selection for CEA among patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study, veterans 65 years and older who received both carotid imaging and CEA in the Veterans Administration between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2009 (n = 2325) were followed up for 5 years. Data were analyzed from January 2005 to December 2015. A risk prediction tool (the Carotid Mortality Index [CMI]) based on 23 candidate variables identified in the literature was developed using Veterans Administration and Medicare data. A simpler model based on the number of 4 key comorbidities that were prevalent and strongly associated with 5-year mortality was also developed (any cancer in the past 5 years, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and chronic kidney disease [the 4C model]). Model performance was assessed using measures of discrimination (eg, area under the curve [AUC]) and calibration. Internal validation was performed by correcting for optimism using 500 bootstrapped samples.Main Outcome and Measure: Five-year mortality.Results: Among 2325 veterans, the mean (SD) age was 73.74 (5.92) years. The cohort was predominantly male (98.8%) and of white race/ethnicity (94.4%). Overall, 29.5% (n = 687) of patients died within 5 years of CEA. On the basis of a backward selection algorithm, 9 patient characteristics were selected (age, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, any cancer diagnosis in the past 5 years, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, remote stroke or transient ischemic attack, and body mass index) for the final logistic model, which yielded an optimism-corrected AUC of 0.687 for the CMI. The 4C model had slightly worse discrimination (AUC, 0.657) compared with the CMI model; however, the calibration curve was similar to the full model in most of the range of predicted probabilities.Conclusions and Relevance: According to results of this study, use of the CMI or the simpler 4C model may improve patient selection for CEA among patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

AB  - Background: End stage renal disease (ESRD) describes the most severe stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD), when patients need dialysis or renal transplant. There is often a delay in recognizing, diagnosing, and treating the various etiologies of CKD. The objective of the present study was to employ machine learning algorithms to develop a prediction model for progression to ESRD based on a large-scale multidimensional database.Methods: This study analyzed 10,000,000 medical insurance claims from 550,000 patient records using a commercial health insurance database. Inclusion criteria were patients over the age of 18 diagnosed with CKD Stages 1-4. We compiled 240 predictor candidates, divided into six feature groups: demographics, chronic conditions, diagnosis and procedure features, medication features, medical costs, and episode counts. We used a feature embedding method based on implementation of the Word2Vec algorithm to further capture temporal information for the three main components of the data: diagnosis, procedures, and medications. For the analysis, we used the gradient boosting tree algorithm (XGBoost implementation).Results: The C-statistic for the model was 0.93 [(0.916-0.943) 95% confidence interval], with a sensitivity of 0.715 and specificity of 0.958. Positive Predictive Value (PPV) was 0.517, and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) was 0.981. For the top 1 percentile of patients identified by our model, the PPV was 1.0. In addition, for the top 5 percentile of patients identified by our model, the PPV was 0.71. All the results above were tested on the test data only, and the threshold used to obtain these results was 0.1. Notable features contributing to the model were chronic heart and ischemic heart disease as a comorbidity, patient age, and number of hypertensive crisis events.Conclusions: When a patient is approaching the threshold of ESRD risk, a warning message can be sent electronically to the physician, who will initiate a referral for a nephrology consultation to ensure an investigation to hasten the establishment of a diagnosis and initiate management and therapy when appropriate.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish consensus recommendations for empirical treatment of uncomplicated cystitis with anti‐infectives in noncatheterized older nursing home residents to be implemented in the Improving Outcomes of UTI Management in Long‐Term Care Project (IOU) funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. DESIGN: Two‐round modified Delphi survey. PARTICIPANTS: Expert panel of 19 clinical pharmacists. MEASUREMENTS: Comprehensive literature search and development/review/edit of draft survey by the investigative group (one geriatric clinical pharmacist, two geriatric medicine physicians, and one infectious disease physician). The expert panel members rated their agreement with each of 31 recommendations for drugs of choice, dosing medications at various levels of renal function, drug‐drug interactions to avoid, and duration of therapy by sex on a 5‐point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). Consensus agreement was defined as a lower 95% confidence limit of 4.0 or higher for the recommendation‐specific mean score. RESULTS: The response rate was 95% for the first round, and three recommendations achieved consensus (dosing for nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in those without chronic kidney disease, and drug‐drug interaction between trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and warfarin). In the second round, 90% responded and reached consensus on an additional eight recommendations (two for nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole as initial drugs of choice, three for dosing ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole at various levels of chronic kidney disease, and three drug‐drug interactions to avoid: trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole with phenytoin and ciprofloxacin with theophylline or with tizanidine). CONCLUSION: An expert panel of clinical pharmacists was able to reach consensus on a set of recommendations for the empirical treatment of cystitis with oral anti‐infective medications in older nursing home residents. The recommendations were incorporated into a treatment algorithm for uncomplicated cystitis in noncatheterized nursing home residents and used in educational materials for health professionals in an ongoing controlled intervention study.

AB  - Clinical information systems contain free-text entries in different contexts to be used in a variety of application scenarios. In this study we investigate to what extent diagnosis codes using the disease classification system ICD-10 can be automatically post-assigned to patient-based short problem list entries, (50 characters maximum). Classifiers using random forest and Adaboost performed best with an F-measure of 0.87 and 0.85 running against an unbalanced data set, and an F-measure of 0.88 and 0.94 using a balanced data set, respectively.

AB  - Each of us reflects a unique convergence of DNA and the environment. Over the past 2 decades, huge biobanks linked to electronic medical records have positioned the clinical and scientific communities to understand the complex genetic architecture underlying many common diseases. Although these efforts are producing increasingly accurate gene-based risk prediction algorithms for use in routine clinical care, the algorithms often fail to include environmental factors. This review explores the concept of heritability (genetic vs nongenetic determinants of disease), with emphasis on the role of environmental factors as risk determinants for common complex diseases influenced by air and water quality. Efforts to define patient exposure to specific toxicants in practice-based data sets will deepen our understanding of diseases with low heritability, and improved land management practices will reduce the burden of disease.

AB  - Aims: Urine proteome analysis (UPA) has already provided accurate discriminatory patterns of urinary peptides for renal disease, coronary artery disease, and asymptomatic LV diastolic dysfunction. UPA has now been used to characterize a discriminatory peptide biomarker pattern and establish a diagnostic classifier for heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods and results: We analysed the urine proteome profiles obtained by capillary electrophoresis online coupled to micro-TOF (time of flight) mass spectrometry of 126 individuals, 59 HFrEF patients and 67 controls matched for age, sex, and renal function. In total, 107 significant discriminatory peptides were identified and used to establish a support vector machine-based classifier that was successfully applied to a test set of 25 HFrEF patients and 33 controls, achieving 84% sensitivity and 91% specificity. The majority of sequenced peptides were fragments of collagen type I and III. Conclusion: UPA was able to identify a set of HFrEF-specific urinary peptide biomarkers on a background of CKD that were successfully utilized to establish a syndrome's classifier.

AB  - Background and purpose Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is undertreated and under-recognized in primary care. The majority of primary care providers (PCPs) are not aware or knowledgeable of current CKD guidelines. The purpose of this project was to develop a quality improvement intervention for PCPs through the delivery of evidence-based guidelines at the point of care. Methods An evidence-based clinical algorithm was developed in the electronic medical record for providers to access within one organization comprising 11 primary care offices with 80 PCPs. Baseline knowledge surveys and baseline data were obtained in August 2016. A CKD educational intervention and tutorial on a clinical decision support (CDS) tool was presented to physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. Postimplementation data and knowledge surveys were collected in December 2016. Conclusions Most PCPs were willing to use a CKD CDS tool to help them with CKD patients. A CDS tool in addition to an educational intervention can improve PCP knowledge and identification of CKD and early referral to nephrology. Implications for practice CDS tools can promote evidence-based guided care for PCPs and CKD patients. By using these applications, patients can be properly identified, managed, treated, and appropriately referred to nephrology.

AB  - Purpose of Study: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a costly and burdensome public health concern. The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact on outcomes and utilization of a pilot program to identify and engage beneficiaries with CKD at risk for progression from Stage 4 to Stage 5. Primary Practice Settings: A quality improvement initiative was conducted to assess the impact of case management on costs and outcomes among 7,720 Cigna commercial medical beneficiaries with Stage 4 CKD enrolled in the United States between January 2012 and October 2012. Methodology and Sample: Claims data were analyzed to compare 3,861 beneficiaries randomized to receive condition-focused case management with 3,859 controls, with follow-up through July 2013. After using an algorithm to identify beneficiaries at highest risk of progression, a case management team implemented, among those assigned to the intervention, an evidence-based assessment tool, provided education and followup, engaged nephrologists and other providers, and conducted weekly rounds. Primary outcome measures were hospital admissions, emergency department visits, nephrologist visits, dialysis, arteriovenous (AV) fistula creation, and total medical costs. Analysis of variance techniques were used to test group differences. Results: As compared with controls, intervention beneficiaries were 12% more likely to have fistula creation ( p = .004). Intervention beneficiaries were observed to have savings of $199 per member per month (PMPM), F = 23.05, p = .04. This difference equated to 6% lower total medical costs in the intervention group. Savings observed were derived half from improved in-network utilization and half from reduced hospital costs. Implications for Case Management Practice: * The observed 12% increased rate of creation of AV fistulas and $199 (6%) decrease in PMPM cost between the intervention and control groups corresponded to a savings of more than $18 million in 2015 U.S. dollars (USD). * On the basis of observation of substantial improvements in outcomes and cost savings, health plan administrators could better serve those at highest risk of progression by implementing focused case management. * Our findings support the value of care coordination between nephrologists, providers, and health plan case managers in improving outcomes and reducing total medical costs among beneficiaries at risk for CKD progression from Stage 4 to Stage 5.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that is associated with increased mortality. Artificial intelligence tools can inform clinical decision making by flagging patients at risk of developing infection and subsequent sepsis. This systematic review aims to identify the optimal set of predictors used to train machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of an infection and subsequent sepsis.Methods: This systematic review was registered in PROSPERO database (CRD42020158685). We conducted a systematic literature review across 3 large databases: Medline, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Embase. Quantitative primary research studies that focused on sepsis prediction associated with bacterial infection in adults in all care settings were eligible for inclusion.Results: Seventeen articles met our inclusion criteria. We identified 194 predictors that were used to train machine learning algorithms, with 13 predictors used on average across all included studies. The most prevalent predictors included age, gender, smoking, alcohol intake, heart rate, blood pressure, lactate level, cardiovascular disease, endocrine disease, cancer, chronic kidney disease (eGFR<60 mL/min), white blood cell count, liver dysfunction, surgical approach (open or minimally invasive), and pre-operative haematocrit < 30 %. All included studies used artificial intelligence techniques, with average sensitivity 75.7 ± 17.88, and average specificity 63.08 ± 22.01.Conclusion: The type of predictors influenced the predictive power and predictive timeframe of the developed machine learning algorithm. Predicting the likelihood of sepsis through artificial intelligence can help concentrate finite resources to those patients who are most at risk. Future studies should focus on developing more sensitive and specific algorithms.

AB  - Aims Primary mitral regurgitation (PMR) can be considered as a heterogeneous clinical disease. The optimal timing of valve surgery for severe PMR remains unknown. To determine whether unbiased clustering analysis using dense phenotypic data (phenomapping) could identify phenotypically distinct PMR categories of patients. Methods and results One hundred and twenty-two patients who underwent surgery were analysed, excluding patients with pre-operative permanent atrial fibrillation (AF), were prospectively included before surgery. They were given an extensive echocardiographic evaluation before surgery, and clinical data were collected. These phenotypic variables were grouped in clusters using hierarchical clustering analysis. Then, different groups were created using a dedicated phenomapping algorithm. Post-operative outcomes were compared between the groups. The primary endpoint was post-operative cardiovascular events (PCE), defined as a composite of: deaths, AF, stroke, and rehospitalization. The secondary endpoint was post-operative AF. Data from three phenogroups with different characteristics and prognoses were identified. Phenogroup-1 (67 patients) was the reference group. Phenogroup-2 (33 patients) included intermediate-risk male and smoker patients with heart remodelling. Phenogroup-3 (22 patients) included older female patients with comorbidities (chronic renal failure, paroxysmal AF) and diastolic dysfunction. They had a higher risk of developing both PCE [(hazard ratio) HR = 3.57(1.72–7.44), P  < 0.001] and post-operative AF [HR = 4.75(2.03–11.10), P  < 0.001]. Pre-operative paroxysmal AF was identified as an independent risk factor for PCE. Conclusion Classification of PMR can be improved using statistical learning algorithms to define therapeutically homogeneous patient subclasses. High-risk patients can be identified, and these patients should be carefully monitored and may even be treated earlier.

AB  - Background: Analyses of the urinary proteome have been proposed as a novel approach for early assessment of increased risk of renal- or cardiovascular disease. Here we investigate the potentials of various classifiers derived from urinary proteomics for prediction of renal and cardiovascular comorbidities in patients with type 2-diabetes.Methods: The study was a post hoc analysis of the randomized controlled Steno-2 trial comparing intensified multifactorial intervention to conventional treatment of type 2-diabetes and microalbuminuria. 151 diabetic patients with persistent microalbuminuria were included in year 1995 and followed for up to 19 years. For renal outcomes, two classifiers (CKD273 and a novel, GFR-based classifier) and for cardiovascular outcomes, three classifiers (CAD238, ACSP and ACSP75) were applied. Renal endpoints were progression to macroalbuminuria, impaired renal function (GFR < 45 ml/min/1.73 m2) or progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) or death. Cardiovascular endpoints were coronary artery disease and a composite endpoint of incident death of cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction or revascularization, stroke, amputation or peripheral revascularization.Results: CKD273 was not consistently associated with renal outcomes. The GFR-based classifier was associated with impaired renal function, but lost significance in extensively adjusted models. Both the ACSP75 and ACSP-scores, but not the CAD238-score were inversely associated (opposing the hypothesis) with cardiovascular endpoints. None of the classifiers improved prediction of any outcome on top of standard risk factors.Conclusions: Risk-scores based upon urinary proteomics did not improve prediction of renal and cardiovascular endpoints on top of standard risk factors such as age and GFR during long-term (19 years) follow up in patients with type 2-diabetes and microalbuminuria.

AB  - A typical problem in causal modeling is the instability of model structure learning, i.e., small changes in finite data can result in completely different optimal models. The present work introduces a novel causal modeling algorithm for longitudinal data, that is robust for finite samples based on recent advances in stability selection using subsampling and selection algorithms. Our approach uses exploratory search but allows incorporation of prior knowledge, e.g., the absence of a particular causal relationship between two specific variables. We represent causal relationships using structural equation models. Models are scored along two objectives: the model fit and the model complexity. Since both objectives are often conflicting, we apply a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to search for Pareto optimal models. To handle the instability of small finite data samples, we repeatedly subsample the data and select those substructures (from the optimal models) that are both stable and parsimonious. These substructures can be visualized through a causal graph. Our more exploratory approach achieves at least comparable performance as, but often a significant improvement over state-of-the-art alternative approaches on a simulated data set with a known ground truth. We also present the results of our method on three real-world longitudinal data sets on chronic fatigue syndrome, Alzheimer disease, and chronic kidney disease. The findings obtained with our approach are generally in line with results from more hypothesis-driven analyses in earlier studies and suggest some novel relationships that deserve further research.

AB  - Objective: Self-management of hypertension can reduce and control blood pressure (BP) compared with clinic monitoring. However, self-management relies on patients following an algorithm, which may be variably adhered to. This study reports fidelity of high-risk patients to the self-management algorithm set by the TASMIN-SR trial.Methods: Patients with hypertension, above target clinic BP and one or more of stroke, diabetes, coronary heart disease or chronic kidney disease, were invited to self-monitor following an individualized self-titration algorithm. Home BP readings and medication change details were submitted monthly for 12 months. Readings downloaded from patients' electronic monitors were compared with written submissions, and protocol fidelity was assessed.Results: Two hundred and seventy-six patients were randomized to self-management and 225 (82%) completed the required training sessions. Of these, 166 (74%) completed self-management. A total of 11385 (89.6%) submitted readings were accurate compared with corresponding downloaded monitor readings. Mean error rate was 5.2% per patient, which increased with age but not comorbidities. Patients made 475 of 683 (69.5%) algorithm-recommended medication changes, equating to nearly three medication changes per patient. Mean SBP for patients who completed training and made all recommended changes dropped from 141 mmHg (95% CI 138.26-144.46) to 121 mmHg (95% CI 118.30-124.17 mmHg) compared with 129 mmHg (95% CI 125.27-136.73 mmHg) for patients who made none.Conclusion: Most patients randomized to self-management completed training; however, 36% of these had dropped out by 12 months. Self-monitoring was largely undertaken properly and accurately recorded. Fidelity with self-management was associated with lower achieved SBP. Successful implementation of self-management into daily practice requires careful training and should be accompanied by monitoring of fidelity.

AB  - Background: Kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease. Short- and long-term kidney graft survival is influenced by a number of donor and recipient factors. Predicting the success of kidney transplantation is important for optimizing kidney allocation.Objective: The aim of this study was to predict the risk of kidney graft failure across three temporal cohorts (within 1 year, within 5 years, and after 5 years following a transplant) based on donor and recipient characteristics. We analyzed a large data set comprising over 50,000 kidney transplants covering an approximate 20-year period.Methods: We applied machine learning-based classification algorithms to develop prediction models for the risk of graft failure for three different temporal cohorts. Deep learning-based autoencoders were applied for data dimensionality reduction, which improved the prediction performance. The influence of features on graft survival for each cohort was studied by investigating a new nonoverlapping patient stratification approach.Results: Our models predicted graft survival with area under the curve scores of 82% within 1 year, 69% within 5 years, and 81% within 17 years. The feature importance analysis elucidated the varying influence of clinical features on graft survival across the three different temporal cohorts.Conclusions: In this study, we applied machine learning to develop risk prediction models for graft failure that demonstrated a high level of prediction performance. Acknowledging that these models performed better than those reported in the literature for existing risk prediction tools, future studies will focus on how best to incorporate these prediction models into clinical care algorithms to optimize the long-term health of kidney recipients.

AB  - Background: Most end-stage renal disease patients rely on hemodialysis (HD) to maintain their life, and they face a serious financial burden and high risk of mortality. Due to the current situation of the health care system in China, a large number of patients on HD are lost to follow-up, making the identification of patients with high mortality risks an intractable problem.Objective: This paper aims to propose a maintenance HD mortality prediction approach using longitudinal HD data under the situation of data imbalance caused by follow-up losses.Methods: A long short-term memory autoencoder (LSTM AE) based model is proposed to capture the physical condition changes of HD patients and distinguish between surviving and nonsurviving patients. The approach adopts anomaly detection theory, using only the surviving samples in the model training and identifying dead samples based on autoencoder reconstruction errors. The data are from a Chinese hospital electronic health record system between July 30, 2007, and August 25, 2016, and 36/72/108 continuous HD sessions were used to predict mortality within prediction windows of 90/180/365 days. Furthermore, the model performance is compared to that of logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, LSTM classifier, isolation forest, and stacked autoencoder models.Results: Data for 1200 patients (survival: 1055, death: 145) were used to predict mortality during the next 90 days using 36 continuous HD sessions. The area under the PR curve for the LSTM AE was 0.57, the Recallmacro was 0.86, and the F1-scoremacro was 0.87, outperforming the other models. Upon varying the observation window or prediction window length, LSTM AE continued to outperform the other models. According to the variable importance analysis, the dialysis session length was the feature that contributed the most to the prediction model.Conclusions: The proposed approach was able to detect patients on maintenance HD with high mortality risk from an imbalanced dataset using anomaly detection theory and leveraging longitudinal HD data.

AB  - Background: There is a growing focus on improving the quality and value of health care delivery for high-cost patients. Compared to fee-for-service Medicare, less is known about the clinical composition of high-cost Medicare Advantage populations.Objective: To describe a high-cost Medicare Advantage population and identify clinically and operationally significant subgroups of patients.Design: We used a density-based clustering algorithm to group high-cost patients (top 10% of spending) according to 161 distinct demographic, clinical, and claims-based variables. We then examined rates of utilization, spending, and mortality among subgroups.Participants: Sixty-one thousand five hundred forty-six Medicare Advantage beneficiaries.Main Measures: Spending, utilization, and mortality.Key Results: High-cost patients (n = 6154) accounted for 55% of total spending. High-cost patients were more likely to be younger, male, and have higher rates of comorbid illnesses. We identified ten subgroups of high-cost patients: acute exacerbations of chronic disease (mixed); end-stage renal disease (ESRD); recurrent gastrointestinal bleed (GIB); orthopedic trauma (trauma); vascular disease (vascular); surgical infections and other complications (complications); cirrhosis with hepatitis C (liver); ESRD with increased medical and behavioral comorbidity (ESRD+); cancer with high-cost imaging and radiation therapy (oncology); and neurologic disorders (neurologic). The average number of inpatient days ranged from 3.25 (oncology) to 26.09 (trauma). Preventable spending (as a percentage of total spending) ranged from 0.8% (oncology) to 9.5% (complications) and the percentage of spending attributable to prescription medications ranged from 7.9% (trauma and oncology) to 77.0% (liver). The percentage of patients who were persistently high-cost ranged from 11.8% (trauma) to 100.0% (ESRD+). One-year mortality ranged from 0.0% (liver) to 25.8% (ESRD+).Conclusions: We identified clinically distinct subgroups of patients within a heterogeneous high-cost Medicare Advantage population using cluster analysis. These subgroups, defined by condition-specific profiles and illness trajectories, had markedly different patterns of utilization, spending, and mortality, holding important implications for clinical strategy.

AB  - Objectives: Pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF) is one of the major complications following total laryngectomy (TL). Previous studies about PCF risk factors showed inconsistent results, and artificial intelligence (AI) has not been used. We identified the clinical risk factors for PCF using multiple AI models.Materials& Methods: Patients who received TL in the authors' institution during the last 20 years were enrolled (N = 313) in this study. They consisted of no PCF (n = 247) and PCF groups (n = 66). We compared 29 clinical variables between the two groups and performed logistic regression and AI analysis including random forest, gradient boosting, and neural network to predict PCF after TL.Results: The best prediction performance for AI was achieved when age, smoking, body mass index, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, hemoglobin level, operation time, transfusion, nodal staging, surgical margin, extent of neck dissection, type of flap reconstruction, hematoma after TL, and concurrent chemoradiation were included in the analysis. Among logistic regression and AI models, the neural network showed the highest area under the curve (0.667 ± 0.332).Conclusion: Diverse clinical factors were identified as PCF risk factors using AI models and the neural network demonstrated highest predictive power. This first study about prediction of PCF using AI could be used to select high risk patients for PCF when performing TL.

AB  - Epidemiological data on prevalence and incidence of chronic hypoparathyroidism are still scarce. This study aimed to establish prevalence of chronic hypoparathyroidism and incidence of surgical hypoparathyroidism using the analysis of electronic anonymous public health care database. Data referred to a 5-year period (2009-2013, Region of Tuscany, Italy, as a sample representative of the whole Mediterranean/European population, estimated mean population: 3,750,000 inhabitants) were retrieved by the analysis of pharmaceutical distribution dataset, containing data related to drugs reimbursed by public health system, hospital discharge and procedures codes, and ICD9 exemption codes for chronic diseases. The application of a specific algorithm was applied to indirectly identify people with chronic hypoparathyroidism as assuming chronic therapy with active vitamin D metabolites (AVDM). The number of people taking AVDM for a period equal to or longer than 6 months till the end of the study period, with ICD9 exemption code for hypoparathyroidism, and with a disease-related discharge code were identified. Within this restricted group, patients with chronic kidney disease and osteoporosis were excluded. The indirect estimate of chronic hypoparathyroidism in a European Mediterranean subpopulation by means of the analysis of chronic therapy with AVDM was 27/100,000 inhabitants (female:male ratio = 2.2:1), with a mean age of 63.5 ± 16.7 years. The risk of developing hypoparathyroidism after neck surgery was 1.5%. While the epidemiological approaches based on disease code and hospital discharge code greatly underestimates the prevalence of hypoparathyroidism, the indirect estimate of this disease through the analysis of prescriptions of AVDM in a European region is in line with the results of studies performed in other regions of the world.

AB  - In order for clinicians to manage disease progression and make effective decisions about drug dosage, treatment regimens or scheduling follow up appointments, it is necessary to be able to identify both short and long-term trends in repeated biomedical measurements. However, this is complicated by the fact that these measurements are irregularly sampled and influenced by both genuine physiological changes and external factors. In their current forms, existing regression algorithms often do not fulfil all of a clinician's requirements for identifying short-term (acute) events while still being able to identify long-term, chronic, trends in disease progression. Therefore, in order to balance both short term interpretability and long term flexibility, an extension to broken-stick regression models is proposed in order to make them more suitable for modelling clinical time series. The proposed probabilistic broken-stick model can robustly estimate both short-term and long-term trends simultaneously, while also accommodating the unequal length and irregularly sampled nature of clinical time series. Moreover, since the model is parametric and completely generative, its first derivative provides a long-term non-linear estimate of the annual rate of change in the measurements more reliably than linear regression. The benefits of the proposed model are illustrated using estimated glomerular filtration rate as a case study used to manage patients with chronic kidney disease.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) anemia is one of the main common comorbidities in patients undergoing End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Iron supplement and especially Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA) have become the treatment of choice for that anemia. However, it is very complicated to find an adequate treatment for every patient in each particular situation since dosage guidelines are based on average behaviors, and thus, they do not take into account the particular response to those drugs by different patients, although that response may vary enormously from one patient to another and even for the same patient in different stages of the anemia. This work proposes an advance with respect to previous works that have faced this problem using different methodologies (Machine Learning (ML), among others), since the diversity of the CKD population has been explicitly taken into account in order to produce a general and reliable model for the prediction of ESA/Iron therapy response. Furthermore, the ML model makes use of both human physiology and drug pharmacology to produce a model that outperforms previous approaches, yielding Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) of the Hemoglobin (Hb) prediction around or lower than 0.6 g/dl in the three countries analyzed in the study, namely, Spain, Italy and Portugal.

AB  - Background: Older patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) are at increased risk for cognitive decline, but detailed studies of the magnitude of cognitive decline on dialysis or comprehensive conservative management (CCM) are lacking and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms have poorly been studied.Objectives: To describe the rationale and design of the COPE study. Study objectives are as follows. Firstly, to examine the severity of cognitive impairment in older patients reaching ESRD before dialysis and the rate of decline after dialysis or CCM initiation. Secondly, to study the association of blood biomarkers for microvascular damage and MRI derived measurements of small vessel disease with the rate of cognitive decline. Thirdly, to examine to what extent cardiac function is related to brain structure and perfusion in patients reaching ESRD. Finally, to study the association of cognitive and functional capacity with quality of life in pre-dialysis patients, as well as after dialysis or CCM initiation.Study Design and Methods: The COPE study is a prospective, multicenter cohort study in the Netherlands, including prevalent and incident pre-dialysis patients ≥65 years old with eGFR ≤20 ml/min/1.73 m2, awaiting either dialysis or CCM initiation. At baseline extensive data is collected including a comprehensive geriatric assessment and laboratory tests. Brain and cardiac MRI for analysis of structural and functional abnormalities are performed at baseline and repeated following therapy change. All other measurements are repeated annually during four years of follow up, including an extra evaluation six months after initiation of dialysis.Conclusions: Knowledge of the magnitude of cognitive decline and its underlying pathophysiological mechanism, as well as its impact on functionality and quality of life can eventually help to postulate an algorithm for well balanced decision making in treatment strategies in older patients reaching ESRD.Clinical Trial Registration: The COPE study is registered on www.ccmo.nl (number: NL46389.058.13).

AB  - Aims: Cyclic variation of heart rate (CVHR) associated with sleep-disordered breathing is thought to reflect cardiac autonomic responses to apnoeic/hypoxic stress. We examined whether blunted CVHR observed in ambulatory ECG could predict the mortality risk.Methods and Results: CVHR in night-time Holter ECG was detected by an automated algorithm, and the prognostic relationships of the frequency (FCV) and amplitude (ACV) of CVHR were examined in 717 patients after myocardial infarction (post-MI 1, 6% mortality, median follow-up 25 months). The predictive power was prospectively validated in three independent cohorts: a second group of 220 post-MI patients (post-MI 2, 25.5% mortality, follow-up 45 months); 299 patients with end-stage renal disease on chronic haemodialysis (ESRD, 28.1% mortality, follow-up 85 months); and 100 patients with chronic heart failure (CHF, 35% mortality, follow-up 38 months). Although CVHR was observed in ≥96% of the patients in all cohorts, FCV did not predict mortality in any cohort. In contrast, decreased ACV was a powerful predictor of mortality in the post-MI 1 cohort (hazard ratio [95% CI] per 1 ln [ms] decrement, 2.9 [2.2-3.7], P < 0.001). This prognostic relationship was validated in the post-MI 2 (1.8 [1.4-2.2], P < 0.001), ESRD (1.5 [1.3-1.8], P < 0.001), and CHF (1.4 [1.1-1.8], P = 0.02) cohorts. The prognostic value of ACV was independent of age, gender, diabetes, β-blocker therapy, left ventricular ejection fraction, sleep-time mean R-R interval, and FCV.Conclusion: Blunted CVHR detected by decreased ACV in a night-time Holter ECG predicts increased mortality risk in post-MI, ESRD, and CHF patients.

AB  - Combined and sequential liver-kidney transplantation (CLKT and SLKT) is a definitive treatment in children with end-stage organ failure. There are two major indications: - terminal insufficiency of both organs, or - need for transplanting new liver as a source of lacking enzyme or specific regulator of the immune system in a patient with renal failure. A third (uncommon) option is secondary end-stage renal failure in liver transplant recipients. These three clinical settings use distinct qualification algorithms. The most common indications include primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), followed by liver diseases associated with occasional kidney failure. Availability of anti-C5a antibody (eculizumab) has limited the validity of CLKT in genetic atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). The liver coming from the same donor as renal graft (in CLKT) is immunologically protective for the kidney and this provides long-term rejection-free follow-up. No such protection is observed in SLKT, when both organs come from different donors, except uncommon cases of living donation of both organs. Overall long-term outcome in CLKT in terms of graft survival is good and not different from isolated liver or kidney transplantation, however patient survival is inferior due to complexity of this procedure.

AB  - Key Points: Question: Is estimated cardiorespiratory fitness (eCRF) in midlife associated with subclinical atherosclerosis, vascular stiffness, and risk of cardiometabolic disease and mortality? Findings: In this cohort study of 2962 Framingham Offspring Study participants, higher midlife eCRF was associated with lower burdens of subclinical atherosclerosis and vascular stiffness, and with a lower risk of hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and mortality over a mean follow-up of 15 years. Meaning: These findings suggest that prognostic ability of midlife eCRF may extend to a wide range of cardiometabolic diseases. This cohort study examines the association of estimated cardiorespiratory fitness in midlife with subclinical atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness, incident cardiometabolic disease, and mortality among participants in the Framingham Offspring Study. Importance: The associations of estimated cardiorespiratory fitness (eCRF) during midlife with subclinical atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness, incident cardiometabolic disease, and mortality are not well understood. Objective: To examine associations of midlife eCRF with subclinical atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness, incident cardiometabolic disease, and mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included 2962 participants in the Framingham Study Second Generation (conducted between 1979 and 2001). Data were analyzed from January 2020 to June 2020. Exposures: eCRF was calculated using sex-specific algorithms (including age, body mass index, waist circumference, physical activity, resting heart rate, and smoking) and was categorized as: (1) tertiles of standardized eCRF at examination cycle 7 (1998 to 2001); (2) tertiles of standardized average eCRF between examination cycles 2 and 7 (1979 to 2001); and (3) eCRF trajectories between examination cycles 2 and 7, with the lowest tertile or trajectory (ie, low eCRF) as referent group. Main Outcomes and Measures: Subclinical atherosclerosis (carotid intima-media thickness [CIMT], coronary artery calcium [CAC] score); arterial stiffness (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity [−1000/CFPWV]); incident hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and mortality after examination cycle 7. Results: A total of 2962 participants were included in this cohort study (mean [SD] age, 61.5 [9.2] years; 1562 [52.7%] women). The number of events or participants at risk after examination cycle 7 (at a mean follow-up of 15 years) was 728 of 1506 for hypertension, 214 of 2268 for diabetes, 439 of 2343 for CKD, 500 of 2608 for CVD, and 770 of 2962 for mortality. Compared with the low eCRF reference value, high single examination eCRF was associated with lower CFPWV (β [SE], −11.13 [1.33] ms/m) and CIMT (β [SE], −0.12 [0.05] mm), and lower risk of hypertension (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46-0.85), diabetes (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.23-0.62), and CVD (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53-0.95), although it was not associated with CKD or mortality. Similarly, compared with the low eCRF reference, high eCRF trajectories and mean eCRF were associated with lower CFPWV (β [SE], −11.85 [1.89] ms/m and −10.36 [1.54] ms/m), CIMT (β [SE], −0.19 [0.06] mm and −0.15 [0.05] mm), CAC scores (β [SE], −0.67 [0.25] AU and −0.63 [0.20] AU), and lower risk of hypertension (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.34-0.87 and HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.34-0.68), diabetes (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.15-0.48 and HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.18-0.54), CKD (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.40-0.97 and HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.44-0.94), and CVD (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.31-0.68 and HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.30-0.60). Compared with the reference value, a high eCRF trajectory was associated with lower risk of mortality (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.50-0.95). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, higher midlife eCRF was associated with lower burdens of subclinical atherosclerosis and vascular stiffness, and with a lower risk of hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. These findings suggest that midlife eCRF may serve as a prognostic marker for subclinical atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness, cardiometabolic health, and mortality in later life.

AB  - Background: Accurate assessment of kidney function is clinically important, but estimates of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by regression are imprecise.Methods: We hypothesized that ensemble learning could improve precision. A total of 1419 participants were enrolled, with 1002 in the development dataset and 417 in the external validation dataset. GFR was independently estimated from age, sex and serum creatinine using an artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), regression, and ensemble learning. GFR was measured by 99mTc-DTPA renal dynamic imaging calibrated with dual plasma sample 99mTc-DTPA GFR.Results: Mean measured GFRs were 70.0 ml/min/1.73 m2 in the developmental and 53.4 ml/min/1.73 m2 in the external validation cohorts. In the external validation cohort, precision was better in the ensemble model of the ANN, SVM and regression equation (IQR = 13.5 ml/min/1.73 m2) than in the new regression model (IQR = 14.0 ml/min/1.73 m2, P < 0.001). The precision of ensemble learning was the best of the three models, but the models had similar bias and accuracy. The median difference ranged from 2.3 to 3.7 ml/min/1.73 m2, 30% accuracy ranged from 73.1 to 76.0%, and P was > 0.05 for all comparisons of the new regression equation and the other new models.Conclusions: An ensemble learning model including three variables, the average ANN, SVM, and regression equation values, was more precise than the new regression model. A more complex ensemble learning strategy may further improve GFR estimates.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, traditional CVD risk prediction equations do not work well in patients with CKD, and inclusion of kidney disease metrics such as albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate have a modest to no benefit in improving prediction.Recent Findings: As CKD progresses, the strength of traditional CVD risk factors in predicting clinical outcomes weakens. A pooled cohort equation used for CVD risk prediction is a useful tool for guiding clinicians on management of patients with CVD risk, but these equations do not calibrate well in patients with CKD, although a number of studies have developed modifications of the traditional equations to improve risk prediction. The reason for the poor calibration may be related to the fact that as CKD progresses, associations of traditional risk factors such as BMI, lipids and blood pressure with CVD outcomes are attenuated or reverse, and other risk factors may become more important.Summary: Large national cohorts such as the US Veteran cohort with many patients with evolving CKD may be useful resources for the developing CVD prediction models; however, additional considerations are needed for the unique composition of patients receiving care in these healthcare systems, including those with multiple comorbidities, as well as mental health issues, homelessness, posttraumatic stress disorders, frailty, malnutrition and polypharmacy. Machine learning over conventional risk prediction models may be better suited to handle the complexity needed for these CVD prediction models.

AB  - Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent widely used in the treatment of various solid tumors. Cisplatin induces nephrotoxicity and may lead to long-term reduction of kidney function. Consequently, determination of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is used to monitor potential kidney damage. This study aimed to compare two commonly used algorithms for estimating GFR (eGFR) from plasma creatinine (PCr) with 51Cr-EDTA clearance (CrCl) as a reference method. This was a retrospective single center study of 94 head and neck cancer patients treated with cisplatin. CrCl was performed once before, during, and after treatment, and PCr was measured concurrently. eGFR was assessed from PCr applying the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) and the Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations. Agreement was assessed applying the statistical methods of Bland and Altman. A predefined limit of clinically acceptable variation between CrCl and eGFR of 14% was applied. Comparison of CrCl and eGFRCKD revealed a positive slope of the linear regression line, suggesting proportional bias (p < 0.001). No systematic bias was found for eGFRCG. Pre-treatment, 42 (46%), 53 (56%) and 48 (53%) observations were within the clinically acceptable limit of variation for standardized eGFRCKD, BSA corrected eGFRCKD, and eGFRCG, respectively. The observed body weight changes were significant. In conclusion, estimated GFRCKD cannot sufficiently replace CrCl in the assessment of GFR during treatment with cisplatin due to systematic bias. Consequently, if CrCl is unavailable, then the CG equation is the better choice provided proper attention is paid to the large variation between methods.

AB  - Acute kidney injury (AKI) is now recognized as a heterogeneous syndrome that not only affects acute morbidity and mortality, but also a patient's long-term prognosis. In this narrative review, an update on various aspects of AKI in critically ill patients will be provided. Focus will be on prediction and early detection of AKI (e.g., the role of biomarkers to identify high-risk patients and the use of machine learning to predict AKI), aspects of pathophysiology and progress in the recognition of different phenotypes of AKI, as well as an update on nephrotoxicity and organ cross-talk. In addition, prevention of AKI (focusing on fluid management, kidney perfusion pressure, and the choice of vasopressor) and supportive treatment of AKI is discussed. Finally, post-AKI risk of long-term sequelae including incident or progression of chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular events and mortality, will be addressed.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate the sonographic and clinical genotype-phenotype correlations in autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) and other cystic kidney diseases (CKD) in a large cohort of prenatally detected fetuses with hereditary CKD.Methods: We retrospectively studied the clinical and diagnostic data of 398 patients referred with prenatal ultrasound findings suggestive of CKD between 1994 and 2010. Cases with confirmed hereditary CKD (n = 130) were analyzed as to their prenatal ultrasound findings, genotype, and possible predictors of clinical outcome.Results: ARPKD was most common in our non-representative sample. Truncating PKHD1 mutations led to a significantly reduced neonatal prognosis, with two such mutations being invariably lethal. Sonographically visible kidney cysts occurred in only 3% of ARPKD cases. Renal abnormalities in Meckel syndrome (MKS) appeared earlier than in ADPKD (19.6 ± 3.7 vs. 29.8 ± 5.1 GW) or ARPKD (19.6 ± 3.7 vs. 30.2 ± 1.2 GW). Additional CNS malformations were not found in ARPKD, but were highly sensitive for MKS. Pulmonary hypoplasia, oligo/anhydramnios (OAH), and kidney enlargement were associated with a significantly worse neonatal prognosis.Conclusion: Genotype, sonographic signs of OAH, enlarged kidney size, and pulmonary hypoplasia can be useful predictors of neonatal survival. We propose sonographic morphological criteria for ARPKD, ADPKD, MKS, and renal cyst and diabetes syndrome (RCAD). We further propose a clinical diagnostic algorithm for differentiating cystic kidney diseases.

AB  - Background: The aim of the study was to determine whether a vancomycin dosing algorithm based on estimated glomerular filtration rate from creatinine and cystatin C levels (eGFRcr-cys) improves target trough concentration achievement compared to an algorithm based on estimated creatinine clearance (eCLcr) in critically ill patients.Study Design: This prospective quality improvement project evaluated intensive care unit (ICU) patients started on intravenous vancomycin using one of 2 different strategies. Dosing regimens were selected and implemented after an individualized goal trough range was established (10-15 or 15-20mg/L). Steady-state goal trough achievement was compared between treatment arms with and without adjustment for potential confounders.Setting& Participants: 3 medical and surgical ICUs at a single tertiary medical center.Quality Improvement Plan: During January 2012 to October 2013, vancomycin was dosed according to eCLcr using the Cockcroft-Gault formula (control arm). During December 2013 to May 2015, a multidisciplinary quality improvement team implemented a novel vancomycin dosing algorithm according to eGFRcr-cys using the CKD-EPI equation (intervention arm).Outcome: Steady-state initial goal vancomycin trough concentration achievement.Measurements& Results: More patients in the intervention arm (67 of 135 [50%]) achieved therapeutic trough vancomycin levels than in the control arm (74 of 264 [28%]; OR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.65-3.90; P<0.001). Improved trough achievement was maintained even after adjustment for age, sex, APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) III score, fluid balance, baseline CLcr, surgical admission diagnosis, presence of sepsis, and goal trough concentration range (adjusted OR, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.76-4.44; P<0.001). Clinical outcomes were similar between groups.Limitations: Nonrandomized, incomplete algorithm compliance.Conclusions: A vancomycin dosing nomogram based on eGFRcr-cys significantly improved goal trough achievement compared to eCLcr among ICU patients with stable kidney function. Further studies are warranted to characterize the relationship between use of cystatin C-guided dosing and clinical outcomes.

AB  - Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is commonly encountered in clinical practice and is associated with poor patient outcomes and increased health care costs. Despite it posing significant challenges for clinicians, effective measures for AKI prediction and prevention are lacking. Previously published AKI prediction models mostly have a simple design without external validation. Furthermore, little is known about the process of linking model output and clinical decisions due to the black-box nature of neural network models.Objective: We aimed to present an externally validated recurrent neural network (RNN)-based continuous prediction model for in-hospital AKI and show applicable model interpretations in relation to clinical decision support.Methods: Study populations were all patients aged 18 years or older who were hospitalized for more than 48 hours between 2013 and 2017 in 2 tertiary hospitals in Korea (Seoul National University Bundang Hospital and Seoul National University Hospital). All demographic data, laboratory values, vital signs, and clinical conditions of patients were obtained from electronic health records of each hospital. We developed 2-stage hierarchical prediction models (model 1 and model 2) using RNN algorithms. The outcome variable for model 1 was the occurrence of AKI within 7 days from the present. Model 2 predicted the future trajectory of creatinine values up to 72 hours. The performance of each developed model was evaluated using the internal and external validation data sets. For the explainability of our models, different model-agnostic interpretation methods were used, including Shapley Additive Explanations, partial dependence plots, individual conditional expectation, and accumulated local effects plots.Results: We included 69,081 patients in the training, 7675 in the internal validation, and 72,352 in the external validation cohorts for model development after excluding cases with missing data and those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or end-stage kidney disease. Model 1 predicted any AKI development with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.88 (internal validation) and 0.84 (external validation), and stage 2 or higher AKI development with an AUC of 0.93 (internal validation) and 0.90 (external validation). Model 2 predicted the future creatinine values within 3 days with mean-squared errors of 0.04-0.09 for patients with higher risks of AKI and 0.03-0.08 for those with lower risks. Based on the developed models, we showed AKI probability according to feature values in total patients and each individual with partial dependence, accumulated local effects, and individual conditional expectation plots. We also estimated the effects of feature modifications such as nephrotoxic drug discontinuation on future creatinine levels.Conclusions: We developed and externally validated a continuous AKI prediction model using RNN algorithms. Our model could provide real-time assessment of future AKI occurrences and individualized risk factors for AKI in general inpatient cohorts; thus, we suggest approaches to support clinical decisions based on prediction models for in-hospital AKI.

AB  - Background: IgA nephropathy is thought to be associated with mucosal immune system dysfunction, which manifests as renal IgA deposition that leads to impairment and end-stage renal disease in 20-40% of patients within 10-20 years. In this trial (NEFIGAN) we aimed to assess safety and efficacy of a novel targeted-release formulation of budesonide (TRF-budesonide), designed to deliver the drug to the distal ileum in patients with IgA nephropathy.Methods: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2b trial, comprised of 6-month run-in, 9-month treatment, and 3-month follow-up phases at 62 nephrology clinics across ten European countries. We recruited patients aged at least 18 years with biopsy-confirmed primary IgA nephropathy and persistent proteinuria despite optimised renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade. We randomly allocated patients with a computer algorithm, with a fixed block size of three, in a 1:1:1 ratio to 16 mg/day TRF-budesonide, 8 mg/day TRF-budesonide, or placebo, stratified by baseline urine protein creatinine ratio (UPCR). Patients self-administered masked capsules, once daily, 1 h before breakfast during the treatment phase. All patients continued optimised RAS blockade treatment throughout the trial. Our primary outcome was mean change from baseline in UPCR for the 9-month treatment phase, which was assessed in the full analysis set, defined as all randomised patients who took at least one dose of trial medication and had at least one post-dose efficacy measurement. Safety was assessed in all patients who received the intervention. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01738035.Findings: Between Dec 11, 2012, and June 25, 2015, 150 randomised patients were treated (safety set) and 149 patients were eligible for the full analysis set. Overall, at 9 months TRF-budesonide (16 mg/day plus 8 mg/day) was associated with a 24·4% (SEM 7·7%) decrease from baseline in mean UPCR (change in UPCR vs placebo 0·74; 95% CI 0·59-0·94; p=0·0066). At 9 months, mean UPCR had decreased by 27·3% in 48 patients who received 16 mg/day (0·71; 0·53-0·94; p=0·0092) and 21·5% in the 51 patients who received 8 mg/day (0·76; 0·58-1·01; p=0·0290); 50 patients who received placebo had an increase in mean UPCR of 2·7%. The effect was sustained throughout followup. Incidence of adverse events was similar in all groups (43 [88%] of 49 in the TRF-budesonide 16 mg/day group, 48 [94%] of 51 in the TRF-budesonide 8 mg/day, and 42 [84%] of 50 controls). Two of 13 serious adverse events were possibly associated with TRF-budesonide-deep vein thrombosis (16 mg/day) and unexplained deterioration in renal function in follow-up (patients were tapered from 16 mg/day to 8 mg/day over 2 weeks and follow-up was assessed 4 weeks later).Interpretation: TRF-budesonide 16 mg/day, added to optimised RAS blockade, reduced proteinuria in patients with IgA nephropathy. This effect is indicative of a reduced risk of future progression to end-stage renal disease. TRF-budesonide could become the first specific treatment for IgA nephropathy targeting intestinal mucosal immunity upstream of disease manifestation.Funding: Pharmalink AB.

AB  - Background: Previous studies have demonstrated that statin therapy improves cardiac outcomes, probably by stabilizing thin-cap fibroatheroma in patients with coronary artery disease. However, major adverse cardiac events still occur in some patients, despite statin therapy. The aim of this study is to identify clinical predictors for the lack of a favorable vascular response to statin therapy in patients with coronary artery disease.Methods and Results: A total of 140 nonculprit plaques from 84 patients with coronary artery disease who were treated with a statin and had serial optical coherence tomography imaging (median interval, 6.3 months) were included. Thin-cap area (fibrous cap thickness, <200 μm) was measured using a novel 3-dimensional computer-aided algorithm. Overall, the thin-cap area significantly decreased from baseline (median, 2.852 mm2; 25th-75th percentile, 1.023-6.157 mm2) to follow-up (median, 1.210 mm2; 25th-75th percentile, 0.250-3.192 mm2; P<0.001), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly decreased from baseline (mean±SD, 92.9±30.1 mg/dL) to follow-up (mean±SD, 76.3±23.3 mg/dL; P<0.001). The general linear model with multiple predictor variables revealed that the thin-cap area was significantly higher in patients with chronic kidney disease than in those without it (regression coefficient b, 1.691 mm2; 95% confidence interval, 0.350-3.033 mm2; P=0.013) and lower in patients with acute coronary syndrome (regression coefficient b, -1.535 mm2; 95% confidence interval, -2.561 to -0.509 mm2; P=0.003).Conclusions: Chronic kidney disease is an independent predictor for the lack of a favorable vascular response to statin therapy, whereas acute coronary syndrome is an independent predictor for favorable vascular response to statin therapy. These findings should be further warranted in future prospective studies.Clinical Trial Registration: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT01110538.

AB  - Background: Opioid use is endemic in the U.S. and is associated with morbidity and mortality. The impact of long-term opioid use on joint-replacement outcomes remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that use of opioids is associated with adverse outcomes after total knee arthroplasty (TKA).Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients who had had TKA within the U.S. Veterans Affairs (VA) system over a 6-year period and had been followed for 1 year postoperatively. The length of time for which an opioid had been prescribed and the morphine equivalent dose were calculated for each patient. Patients for whom opioids had been prescribed for >3 months in the year prior to the TKA were assigned to the long-term opioid group. A natural language processing-based machine-learning classifier was developed to classify revisions due to infectious and non-infectious causes on the basis of the postoperative note. Survival curves for the time to knee revision or manipulation were used to compare the long-term opioid group with the patients who did not take opioids long-term. Hazard and odds ratios for knee revision and manipulation were obtained as well.Results: Of 32,636 patients (94.4% male; mean age [and standard deviation], 64.45 ± 9.41 years) who underwent TKA, 12,772 (39.1%) were in the long-term opioid group and 734 (2.2%) had a revision within a year after the TKA. Chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and long-term opioid use were associated with revision within 1 year-with odds ratios (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) of 1.76 (1.37 to 2.22), 1.11 (0.93 to 1.31), and 1.40 (1.19 to 1.64), respectively-and were also the leading factors associated with a revision at any time after the index TKA-with odds ratios (95% CIs) of 1.61 (1.34 to 1.92), 1.21 (1.08 to 1.36), and 1.28 (1.15 to 1.43), respectively. Long-term opioid use had a hazard ratio of 1.19 (95% CI = 1.10 to 0.24) in the analysis of its relationship with knee revision, but the hazard was not significant in the analysis of its association with knee manipulation. The accuracy of the text classifier was 0.94, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve being 0.99. There was no association between long-term use of opioids and the specific cause for knee revision.Conclusions: Long-term opioid use prior to TKA was associated with an increased risk of knee revision during the first year after TKA among predominantly male patients treated in the VA system.Level Of Evidence: Therapeutic Level III.

AB  - Patients with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) pose an increasingly complex health management challenge worldwide, particularly due to the significant gap in our understanding of how to provide coordinated care. Drawing on our prior research on learning data-driven clinical pathways from actual practice data, this paper describes a prototype, interactive platform for visualizing the pathways of MCC to support shared decision making. Created using Python web framework, JavaScript library and our clinical pathway learning algorithm, the visualization platform allows clinicians and patients to learn the dominant patterns of co-progression of multiple clinical events from their own data, and interactively explore and interpret the pathways. We demonstrate functionalities of the platform using a cluster of 36 patients, identified from a dataset of 1,084 patients, who are diagnosed with at least chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and diabetes. Future evaluation studies will explore the use of this platform to better understand and manage MCC.

AB  - Background: Renal ultrasonography is part of the algorithm in assessing acute kidney injury (AKI). The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical utility of renal US in postoperative cardiac patients who develop AKI.Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of 90 postoperative cardiac surgery patients at a single institution from 1/19/2010 to 3/19/2016 who underwent renal US for AKI. We reviewed provider documentation to determine whether renal US changed management. We defined change as: administration of crystalloid or colloid, addition of inotropic or vasopressor, or procedural interventions on the renal system.Results: Mean age of study patients was 68 ± 13 years. 48/90 patients (53.3%) had pre-existing chronic kidney disease of varying severity. 48 patients (53.3%) had normal renal US with incidental findings and 31 patients (34.4%) had US evidence of medical kidney disease. 10 patients (11.1%) had limited US results due to poor visualization and 1 patient (1.1%) had mild right-sided hydronephrosis. No patients were found to have obstructive uropathy or renal artery stenosis. Clinical management was altered in only 4/90 patients (4.4%), which included 3 patients that received a fluid bolus and 1 patient that received a fluid bolus and inotropes. No vascular or urologic procedures resulted from US findings.Conclusion: Although renal ultrasound is often utilized in the work-up of AKI, our study shows that renal US provides little benefit in managing postoperative cardiac patients. This diagnostic modality should be scrutinized rather than viewed as a universal measure in the cardiac surgery population.

AB  - Background: National levels of personal health-care access and quality can be approximated by measuring mortality rates from causes that should not be fatal in the presence of effective medical care (ie, amenable mortality). Previous analyses of mortality amenable to health care only focused on high-income countries and faced several methodological challenges. In the present analysis, we use the highly standardised cause of death and risk factor estimates generated through the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) to improve and expand the quantification of personal health-care access and quality for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015.Methods: We mapped the most widely used list of causes amenable to personal health care developed by Nolte and McKee to 32 GBD causes. We accounted for variations in cause of death certification and misclassifications through the extensive data standardisation processes and redistribution algorithms developed for GBD. To isolate the effects of personal health-care access and quality, we risk-standardised cause-specific mortality rates for each geography-year by removing the joint effects of local environmental and behavioural risks, and adding back the global levels of risk exposure as estimated for GBD 2015. We employed principal component analysis to create a single, interpretable summary measure-the Healthcare Quality and Access (HAQ) Index-on a scale of 0 to 100. The HAQ Index showed strong convergence validity as compared with other health-system indicators, including health expenditure per capita (r=0·88), an index of 11 universal health coverage interventions (r=0·83), and human resources for health per 1000 (r=0·77). We used free disposal hull analysis with bootstrapping to produce a frontier based on the relationship between the HAQ Index and the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a measure of overall development consisting of income per capita, average years of education, and total fertility rates. This frontier allowed us to better quantify the maximum levels of personal health-care access and quality achieved across the development spectrum, and pinpoint geographies where gaps between observed and potential levels have narrowed or widened over time.Findings: Between 1990 and 2015, nearly all countries and territories saw their HAQ Index values improve; nonetheless, the difference between the highest and lowest observed HAQ Index was larger in 2015 than in 1990, ranging from 28·6 to 94·6. Of 195 geographies, 167 had statistically significant increases in HAQ Index levels since 1990, with South Korea, Turkey, Peru, China, and the Maldives recording among the largest gains by 2015. Performance on the HAQ Index and individual causes showed distinct patterns by region and level of development, yet substantial heterogeneities emerged for several causes, including cancers in highest-SDI countries; chronic kidney disease, diabetes, diarrhoeal diseases, and lower respiratory infections among middle-SDI countries; and measles and tetanus among lowest-SDI countries. While the global HAQ Index average rose from 40·7 (95% uncertainty interval, 39·0-42·8) in 1990 to 53·7 (52·2-55·4) in 2015, far less progress occurred in narrowing the gap between observed HAQ Index values and maximum levels achieved; at the global level, the difference between the observed and frontier HAQ Index only decreased from 21·2 in 1990 to 20·1 in 2015. If every country and territory had achieved the highest observed HAQ Index by their corresponding level of SDI, the global average would have been 73·8 in 2015. Several countries, particularly in eastern and western sub-Saharan Africa, reached HAQ Index values similar to or beyond their development levels, whereas others, namely in southern sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and south Asia, lagged behind what geographies of similar development attained between 1990 and 2015.Interpretation: This novel extension of the GBD Study shows the untapped potential for personal health-care access and quality improvement across the development spectrum. Amid substantive advances in personal health care at the national level, heterogeneous patterns for individual causes in given countries or territories suggest that few places have consistently achieved optimal health-care access and quality across health-system functions and therapeutic areas. This is especially evident in middle-SDI countries, many of which have recently undergone or are currently experiencing epidemiological transitions. The HAQ Index, if paired with other measures of health-system characteristics such as intervention coverage, could provide a robust avenue for tracking progress on universal health coverage and identifying local priorities for strengthening personal health-care quality and access throughout the world.Funding: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

AB  - The rise of evidence-based medicine, medical informatics, and genomics --- together with growing enthusiasm for machine learning and other types of algorithms to standardize medical decision-making --- has lent increasing credibility to biomedical knowledge as a guide to the practice of medicine. At the same time, concern over the lack of attention to the underlying assumptions and unintended health consequences of such practices, particularly the widespread use of race-based algorithms, from the simple to the complex, has caught the attention of both physicians and social scientists. Epistemological debates over the meaning of "the social" and "the scientific" are consequential in discussions of race and racism in medicine. In this paper, we examine the socio-scientific processes by which one algorithm that "corrects" for kidney function in African Americans became central to knowledge production about chronic kidney disease (CKD). Correction factors are now used extensively and routinely in clinical laboratories and medical practices throughout the US. Drawing on close textual analysis of the biomedical literature, we use the theoretical frameworks of science and technology studies to critically analyze the initial development of the race-based algorithm, its uptake, and its normalization. We argue that race correction of kidney function is a racialized biomedical practice that contributes to the consolidation of a long-established hierarchy of difference in medicine. Consequentially, correcting for race in the assessment of kidney function masks the complexity of the lived experience of societal neglect that damages health. • Researchers proposed an estimate for racial difference in kidney function in 1999. • Researchers cited muscle mass as an explanation for racial difference. • Race correction of kidney function only applies to African Americans. • Unexplained racial comparisons imply innate difference. • Race correction in medicine erases health effects of structural conditions.

AB  - Chronic kidney diseases (CKDs) are currently classified according to their clinical features, associated comorbidities and pattern of injury on biopsy. Even within a given classification, considerable variation exists in disease presentation, progression and response to therapy, highlighting heterogeneity in the underlying biological mechanisms. As a result, patients and clinicians experience uncertainty when considering optimal treatment approaches and risk projection. Technological advances now enable large-scale datasets, including DNA and RNA sequence data, proteomics and metabolomics data, to be captured from individuals and groups of patients along the genotype-phenotype continuum of CKD. The ability to combine these high-dimensional datasets, in which the number of variables exceeds the number of clinical outcome observations, using computational approaches such as machine learning, provides an opportunity to re-classify patients into molecularly defined subgroups that better reflect underlying disease mechanisms. Patients with CKD are uniquely poised to benefit from these integrative, multi-omics approaches since the kidney biopsy, blood and urine samples used to generate these different types of molecular data are frequently obtained during routine clinical care. The ultimate goal of developing an integrated molecular classification is to improve diagnostic classification, risk stratification and assignment of molecular, disease-specific therapies to improve the care of patients with CKD.

AB  - Background: Kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment to cure the patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, the infectious complication, especially pneumonia, is the main cause of mortality in the early stage. Immune monitoring by relevant biomarkers provides direct evidence of immune status. We aimed to study the association between immune monitoring and pneumonia in kidney transplant patients through machine learning models.Methods: A total of 146 patients receiving the immune monitoring panel in our center, including 46 pneumonia recipients and 100 stable recipients, were retrospectively reviewed to develop the models. All the models were validated by external data containing 10 pneumonia recipients and 32 stable recipients. The immune monitoring panel consisted of the percentages and absolute cell counts of CD3+CD4+ T cells, CD3+CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells and natural killer (NK) cells, and median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR on monocytes and CD64 on neutrophils. The machine learning models including support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and random forest (RF) were applied for analysis.Results: The pneumonia and stable groups showed significant difference in cell counts of each subpopulation and MFI of monocyte HLA-DR and neutrophil CD64. The SVM model by monocyte HLA-DR (MFI), neutrophil CD64 (MFI), CD8+ T cells (cells/μl), NK cells (cell/μl) and TBNK (T cells, B cells and NK cells, cells/μl) had the best performance with the average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.940. The RF model best predicted the patients who would progress into severe pneumonia, with the average AUC of 0.760. All the models had good performance validated by external data.Conclusions: The immune monitoring panel was tightly associated with pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients. The models developed by machine learning techniques identified patients at risk and predicted the prognosis. Based on the results of immune monitoring, better individualized therapy might be achieved.

AB  - Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used to improve diagnosis and prognostication for acute and chronic kidney diseases. Studies with this objective published in 2019 relied on a variety of available data sources, including electronic health records, intraoperative physiological signals, kidney ultrasound imaging, and digitized biopsy specimens. Key advances: A deep recurrent neural network model using data from electronic health records enables the prediction of inpatient episodes of acute kidney injury (AKI) with lead times of up to 48 hours5. Integrating intraoperative physiological signals into an AKI risk model that dynamically integrates preoperative and intraoperative data improves the prediction of postoperative AKI6. A convolutional deep learning model enables the noninvasive classification of chronic kidney disease stage and estimated glomerular filtration rate using kidney ultrasound images8. A convolutional neural network trained for multiclass segmentation enables automated analysis of transplant biopsy and nephrectomy samples9.

AB  - Objective: To assess the utility of using a computer software program to determine whether epoetin alfa therapy drug use evaluation (DUE) criteria were met. Study design: Computer software was designed to allow pharmacists to enter patient data such as haematocrit results and iron stores into a database. DUE data were collected upon entry into the study (through medical record review), at 6 months and at 12 months after enrollment for both the treatment and control groups (see Interventions section). The analyses of the 6- and 12-month DUE process and outcome criteria were conducted through an automated algorithm that was part of the software. The DUE evaluation was collected as part of a randomised, prospective, controlled study conducted at 32 sites across the US. Interventions: At least 1 pharmacist at each study site completed a 4-day training session on end-stage renal disease and haemodialysis treatment, principles of anaemia management, use of an epoetin alfa software program, and review of specific DUE criteria. The treatment group consisted of patients managed by a trained pharmacist working in collaboration with a nephrologist being responsible for monitoring, evaluating and recommending epoetin alfa dosage regimens for patients. The control group consisted of patients for whom pharmacists monitored and collected haematocrit data but did not recommend therapy to the nephrologists. Main outcome measures and results: There were no statistically significant differences between patients in both the treatment and control groups with regard to the DUE results. However, the study demonstrated that computer databases can assist in determining whether specific DUE criteria have been met at multiple patient care sites. The computer software applied the same consistent methodology across a broad range of hospital practice sites and thus may have minimised investigator bias or site to site variations in criteria application. Conclusions: Future DUE software algorithms should allow investigators/pharmacists to adjust important parameters such as the criterion threshold, time period of monitoring, ability to code 'excused' gaps in data and flexibility to modify criterion parameters.

AB  - Objectives: Recent studies in Central America indicate that mortality attributable to chronic kidney disease (CKD) is rising rapidly. We sought to determine the prevalence and regional variation of CKD and the relationship of biologic and socio-economic factors to CKD risk in the older-adult population of Costa Rica.Methods: We used data from the Costa Rican Longevity and Health Aging Study (CRELES). The cohort was comprised of 2657 adults born before 1946 in Costa Rica, chosen through a sampling algorithm to represent the national population of Costa Ricans >60 years of age. Participants answered questionnaire data and completed laboratory testing. The primary outcome of this study was CKD, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 .Results: The estimated prevalence of CKD for older Costa Ricans was 20% (95% CI 18.5-21.9%). In multivariable logistic regression, older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.08 per year, 95% CI 1.07-1.10, P < 0.001) was independently associated with CKD. For every 200 m above sea level of residence, subjects' odds of CKD increased 26% (aOR 1.26 95% CI 1.15-1.38, P < 0.001). There was large regional variation in adjusted CKD prevalence, highest in Limon (40%, 95% CI 30-50%) and Guanacaste (36%, 95% CI 26-46%) provinces. Regional and altitude effects remained robust after adjustment for socio-economic status.Conclusions: We observed large regional and altitude-related variations in CKD prevalence in Costa Rica, not explained by the distribution of traditional CKD risk factors. More studies are needed to explore the potential association of geographic and environmental exposures with the risk of CKD.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with poor outcomes, perhaps due to a high burden of comorbidity. Most studies of CKD populations focus on concordant comorbidities, which cause CKD (such as hypertension and diabetes) or often accompany CKD (such as heart failure or coronary disease). Less is known about the burden of mental health conditions and discordant conditions (those not concordant but still clinically relevant, like dementia or cancer). Here we did a retrospective population-based cohort study of 530,771 adults with CKD residing in Alberta, Canada between 2003 and 2011. Validated algorithms were applied to data from the provincial health ministry to assess the presence/absence of 29 chronic comorbidities. Linkage between comorbidity burden and adverse clinical outcomes (mortality, hospitalization or myocardial infarction) was examined over median follow-up of 48 months. Comorbidities were classified into three categories: concordant, mental health/chronic pain, and discordant. The median number of comorbidities was 1 (range 0-15) but a substantial proportion of participants had 3 and more, or 5 and more comorbidities (25 and 7%, respectively). Concordant comorbidities were associated with excess risk of hospitalization, but so were discordant comorbidities and mental health conditions. Thus, discordant comorbidities and mental health conditions as well as concordant comorbidities are important independent drivers of the adverse outcomes associated with CKD.

AB  - Objective: The goal of this work was to capture diseases in patients by comprehending the fine-grained medical conditions and disease progression manifested by transitions in medical conditions. We realize this by introducing our earlier work on a state-of-the-art knowledge presentation, which defines a disease as a causal chain of abnormal states (CCAS). Here, we propose a framework, EHR2CCAS, for constructing a system to map electronic health record (EHR) data to CCAS.Materials and Methods: EHR2CCAS is a framework consisting of modules that access heterogeneous EHR to estimate the presence of abnormal states in a CCAS for a patient in a given time window. EHR2CCAS applies expert-driven (rule-based) and data-driven (machine learning) methods to identify abnormal states from structured and unstructured EHR data. It features data-driven approaches for unlocking clinical texts and imputations based on the EHR temporal properties and the causal CCAS structure. This study presents the CCAS of chronic kidney disease as an example. A mapping system between the EHR from the University of Tokyo Hospital and CCAS of chronic kidney disease was constructed and evaluated against expert annotation.Results: The system achieved high prediction performance in identifying abnormal states that had strong agreement among annotators. Our handling of narrative varieties in texts and our imputation of the presence of an abnormal state markedly improved the prediction performance. EHR2CCAS presents patient data describing the temporal presence of abnormal states in CCAS, which is useful in individual disease progression management. Further analysis of the differentiation of transition among abnormal states outputted by EHR2CCAS can contribute to detecting disease subtypes.Conclusion: This work represents the first step toward combining disease knowledge and EHR to extract abnormality related to a disease defined as fine-grained abnormal states and transitions among them. This can aid in disease progression management and deep phenotyping.

AB  - Progressive CKD is generally detected at a late stage by a sustained decline in eGFR and/or the presence of significant albuminuria. With the aim of early and improved risk stratification of patients with CKD, we studied urinary peptides in a large cross-sectional multicenter cohort of 1990 individuals, including 522 with follow-up data, using proteome analysis. We validated that a previously established multipeptide urinary biomarker classifier performed significantly better in detecting and predicting progression of CKD than the current clinical standard, urinary albumin. The classifier was also more sensitive for identifying patients with rapidly progressing CKD. Compared with the combination of baseline eGFR and albuminuria (area under the curve [AUC]=0.758), the addition of the multipeptide biomarker classifier significantly improved CKD risk prediction (AUC=0.831) as assessed by the net reclassification index (0.303±-0.065; P<0.001) and integrated discrimination improvement (0.058±0.014; P<0.001). Correlation of individual urinary peptides with CKD stage and progression showed that the peptides that associated with CKD, irrespective of CKD stage or CKD progression, were either fragments of the major circulating proteins, suggesting failure of the glomerular filtration barrier sieving properties, or different collagen fragments, suggesting accumulation of intrarenal extracellular matrix. Furthermore, protein fragments associated with progression of CKD originated mostly from proteins related to inflammation and tissue repair. Results of this study suggest that urinary proteome analysis might significantly improve the current state of the art of CKD detection and outcome prediction and that identification of the urinary peptides allows insight into various ongoing pathophysiologic processes in CKD.

AB  - Background: Although the potential of big data analytics for health care is well recognized, evidence is lacking on its effects on public health.Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the use of big data analytics on people's health based on the health indicators and core priorities in the World Health Organization (WHO) General Programme of Work 2019/2023 and the European Programme of Work (EPW), approved and adopted by its Member States, in addition to SARS-CoV-2-related studies. Furthermore, we sought to identify the most relevant challenges and opportunities of these tools with respect to people's health.Methods: Six databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews via Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and Epistemonikos) were searched from the inception date to September 21, 2020. Systematic reviews assessing the effects of big data analytics on health indicators were included. Two authors independently performed screening, selection, data extraction, and quality assessment using the AMSTAR-2 (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2) checklist.Results: The literature search initially yielded 185 records, 35 of which met the inclusion criteria, involving more than 5,000,000 patients. Most of the included studies used patient data collected from electronic health records, hospital information systems, private patient databases, and imaging datasets, and involved the use of big data analytics for noncommunicable diseases. "Probability of dying from any of cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes or chronic renal disease" and "suicide mortality rate" were the most commonly assessed health indicators and core priorities within the WHO General Programme of Work 2019/2023 and the EPW 2020/2025. Big data analytics have shown moderate to high accuracy for the diagnosis and prediction of complications of diabetes mellitus as well as for the diagnosis and classification of mental disorders; prediction of suicide attempts and behaviors; and the diagnosis, treatment, and prediction of important clinical outcomes of several chronic diseases. Confidence in the results was rated as "critically low" for 25 reviews, as "low" for 7 reviews, and as "moderate" for 3 reviews. The most frequently identified challenges were establishment of a well-designed and structured data source, and a secure, transparent, and standardized database for patient data.Conclusions: Although the overall quality of included studies was limited, big data analytics has shown moderate to high accuracy for the diagnosis of certain diseases, improvement in managing chronic diseases, and support for prompt and real-time analyses of large sets of varied input data to diagnose and predict disease outcomes.Trial Registration: International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) CRD42020214048; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=214048.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study illustrates a systematic methodology to embed medical costs into the exact flow of clinical events associated with chronic care delivery. We summarized and visualized the results using clinical and cost data, with the goal of empowering patients and care providers with actionable information as they navigate through a multitude of clinical events and medical expenses. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed the electronic health records (EHRs) and medication cost data of 288 patients from 2009 to 2011, whose initial diagnoses included chronic kidney disease stage 3, hypertension, and diabetes. METHODS: We developed chronological pathways of care and costs for each patient from EHR and medication cost data. Using a data-driven method called clinical pathway (CP) learning, which leverages statistical machine-learning algorithms, we categorized patients into clinically similar subgroups based on progressing clinical complexity and associated care needs. The CP-based subgroups were compared against cost-based subgroups stratified by quartiles of total medication costs, and visualized via pathways that are color-coded by costs. RESULTS: Our methods identified 3 CP-based, and 4 cost-based, patient subgroups. Two sets of subgroups from each approach indicated some clinical similarity in terms of average statistics, such as number of diagnoses and medication needs. However, the CP-based subgroups displayed significant variation in costs; conversely, large differences in clinical needs were observed among cost-based subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that CPs extracted from EHRs can be enhanced with appropriate cost information to potentially provide detailed visibility into the variability and inconsistencies in current best practices for chronic care delivery.

AB  - This systematic review aims to provide a more comprehensive overview of the association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). A PubMed search was conducted using the terms "(obstructive sleep disorders OR obstructive sleep apnea OR obstructive sleep apnea syndrome) AND (kidney function OR renal outcome OR chronic kidney disease OR end stage renal disease)". Four hundred seventy four articles were initially retrieved, 227 in the last five years. We included articles with similar definitions of OSA, in particular only diagnosed by polysomnography, in order to exclude bias related to different diagnostic clinical tools, prediction algorithms and questionnaires that affected previous studies. Six cross-sectional and two retrospective studies were analyzed. There were a total of 8795 participants across all the studies with a mean age between 51 and 63 years. One study included only males but the proportion of males in the other studies ranged from 58 to 85.6%. The mean body mass index ranged from 25.2 to 32 kg/m2. The majority of studies considered indicate that OSA and CKD are significantly associated, in particular in their more severe categories. It is of great importance to set up a strong clinical collaboration between sleep medicine and nephrology.

AB  - Background: Health care claims data may provide a cost-efficient approach for studying chronic kidney disease (CKD).Study Design: Prospective cohort study.Setting& Participants: We compared characteristics and outcomes for individuals with CKD defined using laboratory measurements versus claims data from 6,982 REGARDS (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) Study participants who had Medicare fee-for-service coverage.Predictors: Presence of CKD as defined by both the REGARDS Study (CKDREGARDS) and Medicare data (CKDMedicare), presence of CKDREGARDS but not CKDMedicare, and presence of CKDMedicare but not CKDREGARDS, and absence of both CKDREGARDS and CKDMedicare.Outcomes: Mortality and incident end-stage renal disease (ESRD).Measurements: The research study definition of CKD (CKDREGARDS) included estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60mL/min/1.73m(2) or albumin-creatinine ratio > 30mg/g at the REGARDS Study visit. CKD in Medicare (CKDMedicare) was identified during the 2 years before each participant's REGARDS visit using a claims-based algorithm.Results: Overall, 32% of participants had CKDREGARDS and 6% had CKDMedicare. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of CKDMedicare for identifying CKDREGARDS were 15.5% (95% CI, 14.0%-17.1%), 97.7% (95% CI, 97.2%-98.1%), 75.6% (95% CI, 71.4%-79.5%), and 71.5% (95% CI, 70.4%-72.6%), respectively. Mortality and ESRD incidence rates, expressed per 1,000 person-years, were higher for participants with versus without CKDMedicare (mortality: 72.5 [95% CI, 61.3-83.7] vs 33.3 [95% CI, 31.5-35.2]; ESRD: 16.4 [95% CI, 11.2-21.6] vs 1.3 [95% CI, 0.9-1.6]) and with versus without CKDREGARDS (mortality: 59.9 [95% CI, 55.4-64.4] vs 25.5 [95% CI, 23.6-27.4]; ESRD: 6.8 [95% CI, 5.4-8.3] vs 0.1 [95% CI, 0.0-0.3]). Among participants with CKDREGARDS, those with abdominal obesity, diabetes, anemia, lower eGFR, more outpatient visits, hospitalization, and a nephrologist visit in the 2 years before their REGARDS visit were more likely to have CKDMedicare.Limitations: CKDREGARDS relied on eGFR and albuminuria assessed at a single visit.Conclusions: CKD, whether defined in claims or through research study measurements, was associated with increased mortality and ESRD. However, individuals with CKD identified in claims may represent a select high-risk population.

AB  - Background: Urinary protein quantification is critical for assessing the severity of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the current procedure for determining the severity of CKD is completed through evaluating 24-h urinary protein, which is inconvenient during follow-up.Objective: To quickly predict the severity of CKD using more easily available demographic and blood biochemical features during follow-up, we developed and compared several predictive models using statistical, machine learning and neural network approaches.Methods: The clinical and blood biochemical results from 551 patients with proteinuria were collected. Thirteen blood-derived tests and 5 demographic features were used as non-urinary clinical variables to predict the 24-h urinary protein outcome response. Nine predictive models were established and compared, including logistic regression, Elastic Net, lasso regression, ridge regression, support vector machine, random forest, XGBoost, neural network and k-nearest neighbor. The AU-ROC, sensitivity (recall), specificity, accuracy, log-loss and precision of each of the models were evaluated. The effect sizes of each variable were analysed and ranked.Results: The linear models including Elastic Net, lasso regression, ridge regression and logistic regression showed the highest overall predictive power, with an average AUC and a precision above 0.87 and 0.8, respectively. Logistic regression ranked first, reaching an AUC of 0.873, with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.83 and 0.82, respectively. The model with the highest sensitivity was Elastic Net (0.85), while XGBoost showed the highest specificity (0.83). In the effect size analyses, we identified that ALB, Scr, TG, LDL and EGFR had important impacts on the predictability of the models, while other predictors such as CRP, HDL and SNA were less important.Conclusions: Blood-derived tests could be applied as non-urinary predictors during outpatient follow-up. Features in routine blood tests, including ALB, Scr, TG, LDL and EGFR levels, showed predictive ability for CKD severity. The developed online tool can facilitate the prediction of proteinuria progress during follow-up in clinical practice.

AB  - Objective: To develop and recalibrate an Australian 5-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality risk score to produce contemporary predictions of risk.Methods: Data were pooled from six Australian cohort studies (n = 54,829), with baseline data collected between 1989 and 2003. Participants included were aged 40-74 years and free of CVD at baseline. Variables were harmonised across studies and missing data were imputed using multiple imputation. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the risk of CVD mortality associated with factors mutually independently predictive (p < 0.05) and a 5-year risk prediction algorithm was constructed. This algorithm was recalibrated to reflect contemporary national levels of CVD mortality and risk factors using national statistics.Results: Over a mean 16.6 years follow-up, 1375 participants in the six studies died from CVD. The prediction model included age, sex, smoking, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), a social deprivation score, estimated glomerular filtration rate and its square and interactions of sex with diabetes, HDLC and deprivation score, and of age with systolic blood pressure and smoking. This model discriminated well when applied to a Scottish study population (c-statistic (95% confidence interval): 0.751 (0.709, 0.793)). Recalibration generally increased estimated risks, but well below those predicted by the European SCORE models.Conclusions: The resulting risk score, which includes markers of both chronic kidney disease and socioeconomic deprivation, is the first CVD mortality risk prediction tool for Australia to be derived using Australian data. The primary model, and the method of recalibration, is applicable elsewhere.

AB  - A significant number of elderly patients die during their first 3 months of dialysis. Because dialysis can impair the quality of both life and death, a personalized care plan based on both early prognosis and patient choices is required. We developed a prognostic screening tool to identify older patients in need of specific care based on a multidisciplinary approach. Our study included 24,348 patients aged 75 years and older from the French national renal epidemiology and information network (REIN) registry who began dialysis between 1 January 2005 and 30 September 2012. Our primary outcome was overall mortality during the first 3 months of renal replacement therapy. Multivariate logistic regression was used to construct a scoring system in a random half of the cohort (training set). This score, which included age, gender, specific comorbidities, albumin levels, and mobility, was then applied to the other half (validation set). In all, 2548 patients died during the first 3 months after dialysis initiation, 22% after dialysis withdrawal. Three risk groups were identified: low risk (score under 12 points, 3-month expected mortality under 20%), intermediate risk (score from 12 to 16, mortality between 20 and 40%, 9.5% of patients) and high risk (score 17 or more, mortality over 40%, 2.5% of patients). We developed a decision-making process that classifies patients according to their risk of early death in view of their potentially imminent need for supportive care or treatment.

AB  - Objective To uniquely classify children with microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), to describe their demographic characteristics, presenting clinical features, and initial treatments in comparison to patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) (GPA). Methods The European Medicines Agency (EMA) classification algorithm was applied by computation to categorical data from patients recruited to the ARChiVe (A Registry for Childhood Vasculitis: e-entry) cohort, with the data censored to November 2015. The EMA algorithm was used to uniquely distinguish children with MPA from children with GPA, whose diagnoses had been classified according to both adult- and pediatric-specific criteria. Descriptive statistics were used for comparisons. Results In total, 231 of 440 patients (64% female) fulfilled the classification criteria for either MPA (n = 48) or GPA (n = 183). The median time to diagnosis was 1.6 months in the MPA group and 2.1 months in the GPA group (ranging to 39 and 73 months, respectively). Patients with MPA were significantly younger than those with GPA (median age 11 years versus 14 years). Constitutional features were equally common between the groups. In patients with MPA compared to those with GPA, pulmonary manifestations were less frequent (44% versus 74%) and less severe (primarily, hemorrhage, requirement for supplemental oxygen, and pulmonary failure). Renal pathologic features were frequently found in both groups (75% of patients with MPA versus 83% of patients with GPA) but tended toward greater severity in those with MPA (primarily, nephrotic-range proteinuria, requirement for dialysis, and end-stage renal disease). Airway/eye involvement was absent among patients with MPA, because these GPA-defining features preclude a diagnosis of MPA within the EMA algorithm. Similar proportions of patients with MPA and those with GPA received combination therapy with corticosteroids plus cyclophosphamide (69% and 78%, respectively) or both drugs in combination with plasmapheresis (19% and 22%, respectively). Other treatments administered, ranging in decreasing frequency from 13% to 3%, were rituximab, methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil. Conclusion Younger age at disease onset and, perhaps, both gastrointestinal manifestations and more severe kidney disease seem to characterize the clinical profile in children with MPA compared to those with GPA. Delay in diagnosis suggests that recognition of these systemic vasculitides is suboptimal. Compared with adults, initial treatment regimens in children were comparable, but the complete reversal of female-to-male disease prevalence ratios is a provocative finding.

AB  - In the last decade, machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely applied to identify different diseases. This facilitates an early diagnosis and increases the chance of survival. The majority of medical data-sets are unbalanced. Due to this, ML classification techniques give biased classification over the majority class. In this paper, a novel fitness function in Genetic Programming, for medical data classification has been proposed that handles the problem of unbalanced data. Four benchmark medical data-sets named chronic kidney disease (CKD), fertility, BUPA liver disorder, and Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer (WDBC) have been taken from the University of California (UCI) machine learning repository. Classification is done using the proposed technique. The proposed technique achieved the best accuracy for CKD, WDBC, Fertility, and BUPA dataset as 100%, 99.12%, 85.0%, and 75.36% respectively, and the best AUC as 1.0, 0.99, 0.92, and 0.75 respectively. The result outcomes show an improvement over other GP and SVM methods that confirm the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.

AB  - End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is one of the most serious diabetes complications. Numerous studies have been devoted to revealing the risk factors of the onset time of ESRD. In this article, we propose a proportional mean residual life (MRL) model with latent variables to assess the effects of observed and latent risk factors on the MRL function of ESRD in a cohort of Chinese type 2 diabetic patients. The proposed model generalizes the conventional proportional MRL model to accommodate the latent risk factor that cannot be measured by a single observed variable. We employ a factor analysis model to characterize the latent risk factors via multiple observed variables. We develop a borrow-strength estimation procedure, which incorporates the expectation-maximization algorithm and an extended estimating equation approach. The asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are established. Simulation shows that the performance of the proposed methodology is satisfactory. The application to the study of type 2 diabetes reveals insights into the prevention of ESRD. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Electronic Health Record (EHR) data represents a valuable resource for individualized prospective prediction of health conditions. Statistical methods have been developed to measure patient similarity using EHR data, mostly using clinical attributes. Only a handful of recent methods have combined clinical analytics with other forms of similarity analytics, and no unified framework exists yet to measure comprehensive patient similarity. Here, we developed a generic framework named Patient similarity based on Domain Fusion (PsDF). PsDF performs patient similarity assessment on each available domain data separately, and then integrate the affinity information over various domains into a comprehensive similarity metric. We used the integrated patient similarity to support outcome prediction by assigning a risk score to each patient. With extensive simulations, we demonstrated that PsDF outperformed existing risk prediction methods including a random forest classifier, a regression-based model, and a naïve similarity method, especially when heterogeneous signals exist across different domains. Using PsDF and EHR data extracted from the data warehouse of Columbia University Irving Medical Center, we developed two different clinical prediction tools for two different clinical outcomes: incident cases of end stage kidney disease (ESKD) and severe aortic stenosis (AS) requiring valve replacement. We demonstrated that our new prediction method is scalable to large datasets, robust to random missingness, and generalizable to diverse clinical outcomes.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: The universal adoption of electronic health records, improvement in technology, and the availability of continuous monitoring has generated large quantities of healthcare data. Machine learning is increasingly adopted by nephrology researchers to analyze this data in order to improve the care of their patients.Recent Findings: In this review, we provide a broad overview of the different types of machine learning algorithms currently available and how researchers have applied these methods in nephrology research. Current applications have included prediction of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease along with progression of kidney disease. Researchers have demonstrated the ability of machine learning to read kidney biopsy samples, identify patient outcomes from unstructured data, and identify subtypes in complex diseases. We end with a discussion on the ethics and potential pitfalls of machine learning.Summary: Machine learning provides researchers with the ability to analyze data that were previously inaccessible. While still burgeoning, several studies show promising results, which will enable researchers to perform larger scale studies and clinicians the ability to provide more personalized care. However, we must ensure that implementation aids providers and does not lead to harm to patients.

AB  - The substantial nationwide investment in inpatient palliative care services stems from their great promise to improve patient-centered outcomes and reduce costs. However, robust experimental evidence of these benefits is lacking. The Randomized Evaluation of Default Access to Palliative Services (REDAPS) study is a pragmatic, stepped-wedge, cluster randomized trial designed to test the efficacy and costs of specialized palliative care consultative services for hospitalized patients with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, or end-stage renal disease, as well as the overall effectiveness of ordering such services by default. Additional aims are to identify the types of services that are most beneficial and the types of patients most likely to benefit, including comparisons between ward and intensive care unit patients. We hypothesize that patient-centered outcomes can be improved without increasing costs by simply changing the default option for palliative care consultation from opt-in to opt-out for patients with life-limiting illnesses. Patients aged 65 years or older are enrolled at 11 hospitals using an integrated electronic health record. As a pragmatic trial designed to enroll between 12,000 and 15,000 patients, eligibility is determined using a validated, electronic health record-based algorithm, and all outcomes are captured via the electronic health record and billing systems data. The time at which each hospital transitions from control, opt-in palliative care consultation to intervention, opt-out consultation is randomly assigned. The primary outcome is a composite measure of in-hospital mortality and length of stay. Secondary outcomes include palliative care process measures and clinical and economic outcomes. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02505035).

AB  - Background: Prognostic factors for the combination of long-term survival and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after intensive care unit (ICU) stay have not yet been studied. Our aim was to assess whether early acute kidney injury (eAKI), AKI occurring on the first day of ICU admission, is an independent predictor of this combined one-year outcome.Methods: We included all patients admitted to the mixed ICU of the University Medical Centre Utrecht between July 2009 and April 2013, excluding patients with chronic dialysis, cardiac surgery, and length of stay shorter than 24 hours. eAKI was defined using the risk, injury, failure, loss, end-stage renal failure (RIFLE) classification, using a newly developed algorithm to classify AKI based on routinely collected patient data. In one-year survivors, HRQoL was measured using the EuroQoL 5D-3L™ (EQ-5D) questionnaire. The primary outcome measure was "poor outcome", defined as an EQ-5D index score <0.4 or death after one year follow up. A multivariable Poisson regression model was performed to adjust for age, comorbidities, admission type and severity of disease factors.Results: We enrolled 2,420 patients, of whom 871 (36.0 %) died within one year. An additional 286 of 1549 one-year survivors (11.8 %) experienced low HRQoL. The respective incidence of the RIFLE classes, risk, injury and failure, were 456 (18.8 %), 253 (10.5 %) and 123 (5.1 %). After adjustment for other covariates, the RIFLE classes, injury and failure, were independently associated with poor outcome (adjusted relative risk 1.14, 95 % CI 1.01, 1.29; p = 0.03, and 1.25, 95 % CI 1.01, 1.55; p = 0.04), when compared to no eAKI patients . The constituents of this composite outcome were also analysed separately. In a Cox regression model the RIFLE classes, injury and failure, were significantly associated with mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.35, 95 % CI 1.11, 1.65; p <0.01, and 1.78, 95 % CI 1.38, 2.30; p <0.01). In one-year survivors specifically, none of the RIFLE classes were significantly associated with low HRQoL.Conclusions: ICU patients with moderate or severe AKI during the first 24 hours have a higher probability of mortality or low HRQoL (combined poor outcome), one year after ICU admission. Together with other available early prognostic factors, information on early acute kidney injury could improve informed decision-making on the continuation or withdrawal of treatment in ICU patients.

AB  - Background: Pregnancy-related renal cortical necrosis may lead to end-stage renal disease. Although this obstetric complication had virtually disappeared in high-income countries, we have noted new cases in France over the past few years, all following postpartum hemorrhage.Study Design: Case series.Setting& Participants: We retrospectively identified 18 patients from 5 French nephrology departments who developed renal cortical necrosis following postpartum hemorrhage in 2009 to 2013.Outcomes: Obstetric and renal features, therapeutic measures, and kidney disease outcome were studied.Results: All patients had a severe postpartum hemorrhage (mean blood loss, 2.6±1.1 [SD] L). Hemodynamic instability and disseminated intravascular coagulation were reported in 5 and 11 patients, respectively. All developed rapid onset of acute kidney injury and required hemodialysis. Diagnosis of renal cortical necrosis was performed 4 to 33 days following delivery. At 6 months postpartum, 8 patients remained dialysis dependent and none recovered normal kidney function. The length of exposure to tranexamic acid treatment was significantly more prolonged in women whose estimated glomerular filtration rate remained <15mL/min/1.73m(2) (7.1±4.8 vs 2.9±2.4 hours; P=0.03).Limitations: Retrospective study; small sample size.Conclusions: In the setting of gravid endothelium, the conjunction of disseminated intravascular coagulation with the life-saving use of procoagulant and antifibrinolytic agents (recently implemented in France in a postpartum hemorrhage treatment algorithm) may give rise to a risk for uncontrolled clotting in the renal cortex and hence irreversible partial or diffuse cortical necrosis.

AB  - Carotid artery stenting is an effective treatment for ischemic stroke patients with moderate-to-severe carotid artery stenosis. However, the midterm outcome for patients undergoing this procedure varies considerably with baseline characteristics. To determine the impact of baseline characteristics on outcomes following carotid artery stenting, data from 107 eligible patients with a first episode of ischemic stroke were collected by retrospective chart review. A modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was used to divide patients into two baseline groups, mRS ≤2 and mRS >2. A three-step decision-tree statistical analysis was conducted. After weighting the decision-tree parameters, the following impact hierarchy was obtained: admission low-density lipoprotein, gouty arthritis, chronic kidney disease, ipsilateral common carotid artery resistance index, contralateral ophthalmic artery resistance index, sex, and dyslipidemia. The finite-state machine model demonstrated that, in patients with baseline mRS ≤2, 46% had an improved mRS score at follow-up, whereas 54% had a stable mRS score. In patients with baseline mRS >2, a stable mRS score was observed in 75%, improved score in 23%, and a poorer score in 2%. Admission low-density lipoprotein was the strongest predictive factor influencing poststenting outcome. In addition, our study provides further evidence that carotid artery stenting can be of benefit in first-time ischemic stroke patients with baseline mRS scores >2.

AB  - Objective: Angiodysplasias (ADs) are the second leading cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in the elderly. The impact extends from no symptoms to chronic anaemia. Treatment guidelines are lacking. The aim of this study was to assess the current practice of gastrointestinal ADs and explore possible new research areas. On the basis of existing evidence, we would like to propose a treatment algorithm.Methods: We administered a 19-item web-based survey to gastroenterologists in the Netherlands between February and April of 2015.Results: A total of 111 (response rate 28%) gastroenterologists completed the survey (mean age=47 years; 24% women). The respondents identified Von Willebrand disease (17%), chronic kidney disease (21%) and aortic stenosis (77%) as risk factors for the development of ADs. Colonoscopy (54%) and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (43%) were the preferred first tools to screen for ADs. The favoured (77%) first treatment option is endoscopic argon plasma coagulation, whereas 20% start iron supplementation or blood transfusions. Treatment strategy is mostly (65%) based on the location of the ADs. Small bowel ADs are considered the most difficult to treat, because of the need for balloon enteroscopy. Of the gastroenterologists, 13% would treat ADs as a coincident finding during endoscopy. Medical therapy is mostly started in refractory ADs, and thalidomide (40%) is preferred over octreotide (19%). Thalidomide is more preferred by gastroenterologists working in a teaching hospital.Conclusion: Identification of risk factors and treatment of ADs vary widely between gastroenterologists in the Netherlands. Further research is needed to create an evidence-based guideline and thereby optimize the management of symptomatic ADs.

AB  - Patients with CKD are at high risk for adverse safety events because of the complexity of their care and impaired renal function. Using data from our observational study of predialysis patients with CKD enrolled in the Safe Kidney Care study, we estimated the baseline frequency of adverse safety events and determined to what extent these events co-occur. We examined patient-reported adverse safety incidents (class I) and actionable safety findings (class II), conditioned on participant use of drugs that might cause such an event, and we used association analysis as a data-mining technique to identify co-occurrences of these events. Of 267 participants, 185 (69.3%) had at least one class I or II event, 102 (38.2%) had more than one event, and 48 (18.0%) had at least one event from both classes. The adjusted conditional rates of class I and class II events ranged from 2.9 to 57.6 per 100 patients and from 2.2 to 8.3 per 100 patients, respectively. The most common conditional class I and II events were patient-reported hypoglycemia and hyperkalemia (serum potassium>5.5 mEq/L), respectively. Reporting of hypoglycemia (in patients with diabetes) and falling or severe dizziness (in patients without diabetes) were most frequently paired with other adverse safety events. We conclude that adverse safety events are common and varied in CKD, with frequent association between disparate events. Further work is needed to define the CKD "safety phenotype" and identify patients at highest risk for adverse safety events.

AB  - Advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) requires routine renal replacement therapy (RRT) that involves hemodialysis (HD) which may cause increased risk of muscle spasms, cardiovascular events, and death. We used Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method to predict clinical events during the HD sessions. The vital signs, captured using a non-contact bedsensor, and demographic information from the electronic medical records for 109 patients enrolled in the study was used. Weka Workbench software was used to train and validate the ANN model. The prediction model was built using a Multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm as part of the ANN with 10-fold cross-validation. The model showed mean precision and recall of 93.45% and AUC of 96.7%. Age was the most important variable for static feature and heart rate for dynamic feature. This model can be used to predict the risk of clinical events among HD patients and can support decision-making for healthcare professionals.

AB  - Diabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the cause of kidney failure in approximately 35% of Canadian patients requiring dialysis. Traditionally, only a minority of patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD progress to kidney failure because they die of a cardiovascular event first. However, with contemporary therapies for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, this may no longer be true. The classic description of diabetic CKD is the development of albuminuria followed by progressive kidney dysfunction in a patient with longstanding diabetes. Many exciting candidate agents are under study to halt the progression of diabetic CKD; current therapies center on optimizing glycemic control, renin angiotensin system inhibition, blood pressure control and lipid management. Lifestyle modifications, such as salt and protein restriction as well as smoking cessation, may also be of benefit. Unfortunately, these accepted therapies do not entirely halt the progression of diabetic CKD. Also unfortunately, the presence of CKD in general is under-recognized by primary care providers, which can lead to late referral, missed opportunities for preventive care and inadvertent administration of potentially harmful interventions. Not all patients require referral to nephrology for diagnosis and management, but modern risk-prediction algorithms, such as the kidney failure risk equation, may help to guide referral appropriateness and dialysis modality planning in subspecialty nephrology multidisciplinary care clinics.

AB  - A low selenium intake is found in European countries, and is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. There is an association between selenium level and the severity of kidney disease. An association between inflammation and selenium intake is also reported. The coenzyme Q10 level is decreased in kidney disease. The aim of this study was to examine a possible association between selenium and renal function in an elderly population low in selenium and coenzyme Q10, and the impact of intervention with selenium and coenzyme Q10 on the renal function. The association between selenium status and creatinine was studied in 589 elderly persons. In 215 of these (mean age 71 years) a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled prospective trial with selenium yeast (200 µg/day) and coenzyme Q10 (200 mg/day) (n = 117) or placebo (n = 98) was conducted. Renal function was determined using measures of glomerular function at the start and after 48 months. The follow-up time was 5.1 years. All individuals were low on selenium (mean 67 μg/L (SD 16.8)). The changes in renal function were evaluated by measurement of creatinine, cystatin-C, and the use of the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) algorithm, and by the use of T-tests, repeated measures of variance and ANCOVA analyses. An association between low selenium status and impaired renal function was observed. Intervention causes a significantly lower serum creatinine, and cystatin-C concentration in the active treatment group compared with those on placebo (p = 0.0002 and p = 0.001 resp.). The evaluation with CKD-EPI based on both creatinine and cystatin-C showed a corresponding significant difference (p < 0.0001). All validations showed corresponding significant differences. In individuals with a deficiency of selenium and coenzyme Q10, low selenium status is related to impaired renal function, and thus supplementation with selenium and coenzyme Q10 results in significantly improved renal function as seen from creatinine and cystatin-C and through the CKD-EPI algorithm. The explanation could be related to positive effects on inflammation and oxidative stress as a result of the supplementation.

AB  - Purpose. Vancomycin dosing and monitoring algorithms for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving intermittent hemodialysis are reviewed. Summary. Vancomycin is one of the most commonly administered antimicrobial agents in adult patients with ESRD receiving intermittent hemodialysis. However, despite the availability of many published studies, the single best method of vancomycin administration in this population remains unclear. Many studies evaluating vancomycin dosing in adult patients with ESRD receiving intermittent hemodialysis were limited by a small sample size, inappropriate therapeutic targets, older hemodialysis modalities (e.g., low-flux intermittent hemodialysis), and inconsistencies in the timing of dosing or therapeutic drug monitoring. Pharmacokinetic variables that must be accounted for include a prolonged distribution phase, a redistribution phase and rebound effect after completion of hemodialysis, patient weight, residual renal function, and nonrenal clearance. Optimal vancomycin dosing recommendations are needed, but clinicians should always consider patient-specific variables, the timing of vancomycin administration, the timing of serum vancomycin concentrations, and technical aspects of the dialysis procedure when creating a dosing regimen. Conclusion. Individualized vancomycin dosing regimens and therapeutic drug monitoring are necessary for patients with ESRD receiving intermittent hemodialysis to ensure that goal serum vancomycin levels are reached to adequately treat an infection.

AB  - Key Points: Question: What is the accuracy of a single-center machine learning algorithm for predicting acute kidney injury (AKI) when internally and externally tested? Findings: In this multicenter diagnostic study of approximately 500 000 admissions from 6 hospitals in 3 health systems, the machine learning algorithm had similarly high discrimination in both internal and external validation cohorts. Alert thresholds fired nearly a day and a half before the event. Meaning: These findings demonstrate that the AKI algorithm is generalizable to patients in the center in which it was derived and to patients from other hospitals, suggesting that implementation could prompt early identification and therapy aimed at decreasing preventable AKI. This diagnostic study internally and externally validates a machine learning risk score for detecting acute kidney injury in hospitalized patients. Importance: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Current methods to identify patients at high risk of AKI are limited, and few prediction models have been externally validated. Objective: To internally and externally validate a machine learning risk score to detect AKI in hospitalized patients. Design, Setting, and Participants: This diagnostic study included 495 971 adult hospital admissions at the University of Chicago (UC) from 2008 to 2016 (n = 48 463), at Loyola University Medical Center (LUMC) from 2007 to 2017 (n = 200 613), and at NorthShore University Health System (NUS) from 2006 to 2016 (n = 246 895) with serum creatinine (SCr) measurements. Patients with an SCr concentration at admission greater than 3.0 mg/dL, with a prior diagnostic code for chronic kidney disease stage 4 or higher, or who received kidney replacement therapy within 48 hours of admission were excluded. A simplified version of a previously published gradient boosted machine AKI prediction algorithm was used; it was validated internally among patients at UC and externally among patients at NUS and LUMC. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prediction of Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes SCr-defined stage 2 AKI within a 48-hour interval was the primary outcome. Discrimination was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: The study included 495 971 adult admissions (mean [SD] age, 63 [18] years; 87 689 [17.7%] African American; and 266 866 [53.8%] women) across 3 health systems. The development of stage 2 or higher AKI occurred in 15 664 of 48 463 patients (3.4%) in the UC cohort, 5711 of 200 613 (2.8%) in the LUMC cohort, and 3499 of 246 895 (1.4%) in the NUS cohort. In the UC cohort, 332 patients (0.7%) required kidney replacement therapy compared with 672 patients (0.3%) in the LUMC cohort and 440 patients (0.2%) in the NUS cohort. The AUCs for predicting at least stage 2 AKI in the next 48 hours were 0.86 (95% CI, 0.86-0.86) in the UC cohort, 0.85 (95% CI, 0.84-0.85) in the LUMC cohort, and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.86-0.86) in the NUS cohort. The AUCs for receipt of kidney replacement therapy within 48 hours were 0.96 (95% CI, 0.96-0.96) in the UC cohort, 0.95 (95% CI, 0.94-0.95) in the LUMC cohort, and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.94-0.95) in the NUS cohort. In time-to-event analysis, a probability cutoff of at least 0.057 predicted the onset of stage 2 AKI a median (IQR) of 27 (6.5-93) hours before the eventual doubling in SCr concentrations in the UC cohort, 34.5 (19-85) hours in the NUS cohort, and 39 (19-108) hours in the LUMC cohort. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, the machine learning algorithm demonstrated excellent discrimination in both internal and external validation, supporting its generalizability and potential as a clinical decision support tool to improve AKI detection and outcomes.

AB  - Context: Uremic pruritus (UP) affects up to half of all patients with kidney disease and has been independently associated with poor patient outcomes. UP is a challenging symptom for clinicians to manage as there are no validated guidelines for its treatment.Objectives: The study aimed to develop and validate an algorithm and patient information toolkit for the treatment of UP in patients with kidney disease.Methods: The study involved a literature search and development of an initial draft algorithm, followed by content and face validation of this algorithm. Validation entailed three rounds of interviews with six nephrology clinicians per round. Participants assessed the relevance of each component of the algorithm and then rated a series of statements on a scale of 1-5 to assess face validity of the algorithm. After each round, the content validity index (CVI) of each algorithm component was calculated, and the algorithm was revised by the study team in response to findings. This process was followed by a second study that developed and validated a patient information pamphlet and video.Results: Algorithm validation participants were affiliated with three institutions and included seven physicians, four registered nurses, three nurse practitioners, three pharmacists, and a dietician. The average CVI of the algorithm components across all three rounds was 0.89, with 0.80 commonly cited as the lower acceptable limit for content validation. More than 78% of participants rated each face validity statement as "Agree" or "Strongly Agree". For the patient information tools, five clinicians and 15 patients were included in validation. The average CVI was 1.00 for both tools, and the average face validity was 92%.Conclusion: A treatment algorithm and patient information toolkit for managing UP in patients with kidney disease were developed and validated through expert review. Further research will be conducted on implementation of the treatment algorithm and evaluating patient-reported outcomes.

AB  - Stem cell-based regenerative therapies may rescue the central nervous system following ischemic stroke. Mesenchymal stem cells exhibit promising regenerative capacity in in vitro studies but display little to no incorporation in host tissue after transplantation in in vivo models of stroke. Despite these limitations, clinical trials using mesenchymal stem cells have produced some functional benefits ascribed to their ability to modulate the host's inflammatory response coupled with their robust safety profile. Regeneration of ischemic brain tissue using stem cells, however, remains elusive in humans. Multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring (Muse) cells are a distinct subset of mesenchymal stem cells found sporadically in connective tissue of nearly every organ. Since their discovery in 2010, these endogenous reparative stem cells have been investigated for their therapeutic potential against a variety of diseases, including acute myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic kidney disease, and liver disease. Preclinical studies have exemplified Muse cells' unique ability mobilize, differentiate, and engraft into damaged host tissue. Intravenously transplanted Muse cells in mouse lacunar stroke models afforded functional recovery and long-term engraftment into the host neural network. This mini-review article highlights these biological properties that make Muse cells an exceptional candidate donor source for cell therapy in ischemic stroke. Elucidating the mechanism behind the therapeutic potential of Muse cells will undoubtedly help optimize stem cell therapy for stroke and advance the field of regenerative medicine.

AB  - The accurate prediction of progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is of great importance to clinicians and a challenge to researchers as there are many causes and even more comorbidities that are ignored by the traditional prediction models. We examine whether utilizing a novel low-dimensional embedding model disease2disease (D2D) learned from a large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) could well clusters the causes of kidney diseases and comorbidities and further improve prediction of progression of CKD to ESRD compared to traditional risk factors. The study cohort consists of 2,507 hospitalized Stage 3 CKD patients of which 1,375 (54.8%) progressed to ESRD within 3 years. We evaluated the proposed unsupervised learning framework by applying a regularized logistic regression model and a cox proportional hazard model respectively, and compared the accuracies with the ones obtained by four alternative models. The results demonstrate that the learned low-dimensional disease representations from EHRs can capture the relationship between vast arrays of diseases, and can outperform traditional risk factors in a CKD progression prediction model. These results can be used both by clinicians in patient care and researchers to develop new prediction methods.

AB  - The most severe form of kidney disease, End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is treated with various forms of dialysis - artificial blood cleansing. Dialysis patients suffer many health burdens including high mortality and hospitalization rates, and symptomatic anemia: a low red blood cell count as indicated by a low hemoglobin (Hgb) level. ESRD-induced anemia is treated, with variable patient response, by erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs): expensive injectable medications typically administered during dialysis sessions. The dosing protocol is typically a population level protocol based on original clinical trials, the use of which often results in Hgb cycling. This cycling phenomenon occurs primarily due to the mismatch in the time between dosing decisions and the time it takes for the effects of a dosing change to be fully realized. In this paper we develop a recurrent neural network approach that uses historic data together with future ESA and iron dosing data to predict the 1, 2, and 3 month Hgb levels of patients with ESRD-induced anemia. The results of extensive experimentation indicate that this approach generates predictions that are clinically relevant: the mean absolute error of the predictions is comparable to estimates of the intra-individual variability of the laboratory test for Hgb.

AB  - Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESAs) have become a standard anemia management tool for End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients. However, dose optimization constitutes an extremely challenging task due to huge inter and intra-patient variability in the responses to ESA administration. Current data-based approaches to anemia control focus on learning accurate hemoglobin prediction models, which can be later utilized for testing competing treatment choices and choosing the optimal one. These methods, despite being proven effective in practice, present several shortcomings which this paper intends to tackle. Namely, they are limited to a small cohort of patients and, even then, they fail to provide suggestions when some strict requirements are not met (such as having a three month history prior to the prediction). Here, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are used to model whole patient histories, providing predictions at every time step since the very first day. Furthermore, an unprecedented amount of data (∼110,000 patients from many different medical centers in twelve countries, without exclusion criteria) was used to train it, thus allowing it to generalize for every single patient. The resulting model outperforms state-of-the-art Hemoglobin prediction, providing excellent results even when tested on a prospective dataset. Simultaneously, it allows to bring the benefits of algorithmic anemia control to a very large group of patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is important in clinical practice. Current models derived from regression are limited by the imprecision of GFR estimates. We hypothesized that an artificial neural network (ANN) might improve the precision of GFR estimates. STUDY DESIGN: A study of diagnostic test accuracy. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 1,230 patients with chronic kidney disease were enrolled, including the development cohort (n=581), internal validation cohort (n=278), and external validation cohort (n=371). INDEX TESTS: Estimated GFR (eGFR) using a new ANN model and a new regression model using age, sex, and standardized serum creatinine level derived in the development and internal validation cohort, and the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) 2009 creatinine equation. REFERENCE TEST: Measured GFR (mGFR). OTHER MEASUREMENTS: GFR was measured using a diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid renal dynamic imaging method. Serum creatinine was measured with an enzymatic method traceable to isotope-dilution mass spectrometry. RESULTS: In the external validation cohort, mean mGFR was 49±27 (SD) mL/min/1.73m(2) and biases (median difference between mGFR and eGFR) for the CKD-EPI, new regression, and new ANN models were 0.4, 1.5, and -0.5mL/min/1.73m(2), respectively (P<0.001 and P=0.02 compared to CKD-EPI and P<0.001 comparing the new regression and ANN models). Precisions (IQRs for the difference) were 22.6, 14.9, and 15.6mL/min/1.73m(2), respectively (P<0.001 for both compared to CKD-EPI and P<0.001 comparing the new ANN and new regression models). Accuracies (proportions of eGFRs not deviating >30% from mGFR) were 50.9%, 77.4%, and 78.7%, respectively (P<0.001 for both compared to CKD-EPI and P=0.5 comparing the new ANN and new regression models). LIMITATIONS: Different methods for measuring GFR were a source of systematic bias in comparisons of new models to CKD-EPI, and both the derivation and validation cohorts consisted of a group of patients who were referred to the same institution. CONCLUSIONS: An ANN model using 3 variables did not perform better than a new regression model. Whether ANN can improve GFR estimation using more variables requires further investigation.

AB  - Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is associated with the risk of developing chronic disease (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancers and chronic kidney disease) and has an important role in early prevention. Previous research showed that an artificial neural network (ANN) is a suitable tool for algorithmic MetS diagnostics, that includes solely non-invasive, low-cost and easily-obtainabled (NI&LC&EO) diagnostic methods. This paper considers using four well-known machine learning methods (linear regression, artificial neural network, decision tree and random forest) for MetS predictions and provides their comparison, in order to induce and facilitate development of appropriate medical software by using these methods. Training, validation and testing are conducted on the large dataset that includes 3000 persons. Input vectors are very simple and contain the following parameters: gender, age, body mass index, waist-to-height ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, while the output is MetS diagnosis in true/false form, made in accordance with International Diabetes Federation (IDF). Comparison leads to the conclusion that random forest achieves the highest specificity (SPC=0.9436), sensitivity (SNS=0.9154), positive (PPV=0.9379) and negative (NPV=0.9150) predictive values. Algorithmic diagnosis of MetS could be beneficial in everyday clinical practice since it can easily identify high risk patients.

AB  - In 2019, the International Diabetes Federation attributed 4.2 million deaths due to diabetes.1 In the United States, diabetes was said to be the seventh leading cause of death in 2017; this information was based on over 83,000 death certificates.2 Over half a million people died in the United Kingdom3 in 2017 and, in the same year, 117,000 of these individuals had diabetes.4 The cause of death in these individuals is not usually attributed to acute diabetes complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) or hypoglycaemia, but to the long‐term complications which occur in individuals living with the condition such as cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and dementia or respiratory disease or cancer. A holistic approach to the care of people living with diabetes as they near the end of their lives is important if acute metabolic complications, unnecessary treatment regimens and excessive monitoring are to be avoided.5 Individuals with diabetes will undoubtedly face additional psychological and clinical challenges as they enter end of life care. This article takes a practical approach to end of life care in people with diabetes; it includes national and international recommendations and simple algorithms developed to support health care professionals caring for these individuals.

AB  - Background: Previous researches has depicted that the performance of the recommended glomerular filtration rate (GFR)-estimating equations in the type 2 diabetic population is inferior to that in the non-diabetic population. We attempted to develop new GFR-predicting models for use in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes in this study.Methods: We enrolled 519 type 2 diabetic patients including a development data-set (n = 276), an internal validation data-set (n = 138) and an external validation data-set (n = 105) to establish new GFR-predicting models. 99mTc-DTPA-GFR revised by the dual sample method was referred to as the gold GFR standard.Results: Based on sex, age, serum creatinine and new predictor variables [body mass index (BMI), hemoglobinA1C, and urinary albumin creatinine ratio], eight new regression models and eight artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed. In the external validation group, only ANN3 was superior in both precision and accuracy over the original CKD-EPI equation (precision, 20.5 vs. 24.2 mL/min/1.73 m(2), P < 0.001; 30 % accuracy, 88.6 vs. 80.6 %, P = 0.02).Conclusions: ANN3 based on sex, age, serum creatinine and BMI is the optimal model for GFR estimation in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health problem, exhibiting sharp increases in incidence, prevalence, and attributable morbidity and mortality. There is a critical need to better understand the demographics, clinical characteristics, and key risk factors for CKD; and to develop platforms for testing novel interventions to improve modifiable risk factors, particularly for the CKD patients with a rapid decline in kidney function.Methods: We describe a novel collaboration between two large healthcare systems (Providence St. Joseph Health and University of California, Los Angeles Health) supported by leadership from both institutions, which was created to develop harmonized cohorts of patients with CKD or those at increased risk for CKD (hypertension/HTN, diabetes/DM, pre-diabetes) from electronic health record data.Results: The combined repository of candidate records included more than 3.3 million patients with at least a single qualifying measure for CKD and/or at-risk for CKD. The CURE-CKD registry includes over 2.6 million patients with and/or at-risk for CKD identified by stricter guide-line based criteria using a combination of administrative encounter codes, physical examinations, laboratory values and medication use. Notably, data based on race/ethnicity and geography in part, will enable robust analyses to study traditionally disadvantaged or marginalized patients not typically included in clinical trials.Discussion: CURE-CKD project is a unique multidisciplinary collaboration between nephrologists, endocrinologists, primary care physicians with health services research skills, health economists, and those with expertise in statistics, bio-informatics and machine learning. The CURE-CKD registry uses curated observations from real-world settings across two large healthcare systems and has great potential to provide important contributions for healthcare and for improving clinical outcomes in patients with and at-risk for CKD.

AB  - We extend a random pattern mixture joint model for longitudinal ordinal outcomes and informative dropouts. The patients are generalized to 'pattern' groups based on known covariates that are potentially surrogated for the severity of the underlying condition. The random pattern effects are defined as the latent effects linking the dropout process and the ordinal longitudinal outcome. Conditional on the random pattern effects, the longitudinal outcome and the dropout times are assumed independent. Estimates are obtained via the Expectation-maximization algorithm. We applied the model to the end-stage renal disease data. Anemia was found to be significantly affected by the baseline iron treatment when the dropout information was adjusted via the study model; as opposed to an independent or shared parameter model. Simulations were performed to evaluate the performance of the random pattern mixture model under various assumptions.

AB  - Objective We examined the disposition and outcomes of patients presenting to the ED with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome undergoing measurement of troponin T using a highly sensitive assay. Methods Troponin T (TnT) was measured in 204 consecutive patients (mean age = 65 [±18] years, 55% men) presenting to the ED with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. Results Ninety-four patients predominantly had chest pain, 34 had dyspnoea and the remainder had various symptoms. Overall, 96 patients had TnT >14 ng/L (upper reference limit), of whom 31 were admitted to the cardiology service (26 had final cardiac diagnosis [five ST-elevation MI, 10 non- ST-elevation MI, one unstable angina and 10 other cardiac]). Among these 96 patients, 41 had chronic kidney disease, 17 had heart failure and seven had sepsis. At 30 days, death rates among patients who had TnT >14 ng/L with non-cardiac diagnoses and in patients who had TnT >14 ng/L with a cardiac diagnosis were 6.6% and 2.9% ( P = 0.652); no death and/or MI occurred in patients with normal TnT levels. At late follow up (median 6.8 months) that was obtained in 189 (93% of 204) patients, four had MI and 14 died (three cardiac deaths). Conclusions Despite high-sensitivity TnT assay having a high sensitivity and specificity for myocardial necrosis, the majority of unselected consecutive patients attending ED in whom TnT levels were elevated did not have an acute coronary syndrome. Our pilot study suggests that a larger study is needed to provide evidence to modify management algorithms.

AB  - Purpose: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is classified according to cause, glomerular filtration rate, and proteinuria. Identification of proteinuria with urinalysis (UA) is less accurate than quantification via other methods. We investigated factors leading to discordant UA findings when compared against paired albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) testing.Methods: Four thousand three hundred and twenty-three UAs were grouped by proteinuria level (A1-A3); concordance with ACR was examined. Classification of UA with confounding factors (UA+CF) or without (UA-CF) was based on CF that resulted in >10% increase in false-positive proteinuria readings. The presence of ≥3+ blood, ≥3+ leukocyte esterase, any ketonuria, specific gravity ≥1.020, ≥1+ urobilinogen, ≥2+ bilirubin, ≥2+ bacteria, ≥3 RBC/hpf (high powered field), ≥10 WBC/hpf, and/or ≥6 epithelial cells/hpf led to UA+CF classification.Results: Proteinuria was determined to be present in 14.1% by UA dipstick and 24.9% by ACR. Using ACR as the standard, overall concordance was 80.4%, with 17.2% false-negatives and 2.3% false-positives by UA. UA+CF represented 55.6% of UA overall (n = 2404), and 98.0% of those false-positive for proteinuria. High specific gravity and hematuria are the strongest predictors of false positives. For A2 proteinuria (30-300 mg/g, 1+,2+,3+ on UA) UA-CF had a higher negative predictive value (NPV) (99.8%) than UA+CF (77.6%); NPV for A3 proteinuria (>300 mg/g, 4+ on UA) was 100% for UA-CF and UA+CF.Conclusion: Additional abnormalities were noted in >50% of outpatient UAs indicating proteinuria. Given the significant proportion of patients having a false-positive UA for proteinuria when these CFs were present, we recommend that such patients undergo ACR confirmatory testing, according to a clinical algorithm for the incorporation of UA results into the management of CKD.

AB  - Background: In the era of information explosion, the use of the internet to assist with clinical practice and diagnosis has become a cutting-edge area of research. The application of medical informatics allows patients to be aware of their clinical conditions, which may contribute toward the prevention of several chronic diseases and disorders.Objective: In this study, we applied machine learning techniques to construct a medical database system from electronic medical records (EMRs) of subjects who have undergone health examination. This system aims to provide online self-health evaluation to clinicians and patients worldwide, enabling personalized health and preventive health.Methods: We built a medical database system based on the literature, and data preprocessing and cleaning were performed for the database. We utilized both supervised and unsupervised machine learning technology to analyze the EMR data to establish prediction models. The models with EMR databases were then applied to the internet platform.Results: The validation data were used to validate the online diagnosis prediction system. The accuracy of the prediction model for metabolic syndrome reached 91%, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.904 in this system. For chronic kidney disease, the prediction accuracy of the model reached 94.7%, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.982. In addition, the system also provided disease diagnosis visualization via clustering, allowing users to check their outcome compared with those in the medical database, enabling increased awareness for a healthier lifestyle.Conclusions: Our web-based health care machine learning system allowed users to access online diagnosis predictions and provided a health examination report. Users could understand and review their health status accordingly. In the future, we aim to connect hospitals worldwide with our platform, so that health care practitioners can make diagnoses or provide patient education to remote patients. This platform can increase the value of preventive medicine and telemedicine.

AB  - Background: In recent years, the use of biochemical markers has received increasing attention for purposes of risk assessment and clinical management in renal failure patients. Chemometric methods are often used in medical studies and there are already indications for their specific role as a tool of the medical statistics.Methods: Three chemometric methods, discriminant analysis (DA), binary logistic regression analysis (BLRA), and cluster analysis (CA), were used for assessment and modeling of routinely used biochemical laboratory data of 18 parameters that were determined from 185 healthy individuals (HIs) and 173 end-stage renal failure (ESRF) patients.Results: The above-mentioned chemometric methods were performed using the data set of 14 parameters since the rest 4 parameters did not present significant difference between healthy and patients. DA created a model using only ALB (Albumin), K (Potassium), TG (Triglyceride), and ALP (Alkaline phosphatase); BLRA model also used the above four parameters; CA classified all the cases into two clusters using the same four parameters and one more parameter, AST (aspartate aminotransferase).Conclusions: This study provides models for assessment and modeling of routinely used biochemical laboratory data, finding groups of similarity among clinical tests usually determined on HIs and ESRF patients, contributing in data mining and reducing costs.

AB  - Introduction: Early initiated and long-term sustained intensive glucose control is associated with a significantly decreased risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality, over and above the well-established decline in the risk of microvascular disease. Based on the recent cardiovascular outcome trial (CVOT) data, this review focuses on the various benefits of the newer medications with their positioning in the treatment algorithm and explores the place of the older medications in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).Areas Covered: We searched the literature for glucose-lowering therapies for patients with T2DM. We included CVOTs conducted for newer sulphonylureas, thiazolidinediones, insulin degludec, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 receptor agonists.Expert Opinion: Selection of glucose-lowering therapy in the management of T2DM should be individualized and based on patient characteristics, associated comorbidities, patient preference, affordability and adherence to treatment. In view of the benefits seen in the CVOTs with SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists, these newer classes should be the preferred choice in patients with/without established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease.

AB  - LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) is an important marker of coronary risk in the general population, but its utility in people with CKD is unclear. We studied 836,060 adults from the Alberta Kidney Disease Network with at least one measurement of fasting LDL-C, estimated GFR (eGFR), and proteinuria between 2002 and 2009. All participants were free of stage 5 CKD at cohort entry. We followed participants from first eGFR measurement to March 31, 2009; we used validated algorithms applied to administrative data to ascertain primary outcome (hospitalization for myocardial infarction) and Cox regression to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for myocardial infarction by LDL-C categories within eGFR strata. During median follow-up of 48 months, 7762 patients were hospitalized for myocardial infarction, with incidence highest among participants with the lowest eGFR. Compared with 2.6-3.39 mmol/L (referent), the risk associated with having LDL-C above 4.9 mmol/L seemed greatest for GFR≥90 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and least for eGFR=15-59.9 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Specifically, the adjusted HRs (95% confidence intervals) of myocardial infarction associated with LDL-C of ≥4.9 compared with 2.6-3.39 mmol/L in participants with eGFR=15-59.9, 60-89.9, and ≥90 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) were 2.06 (1.59, 2.67), 2.30 (2.00, 2.65), and 3.01 (2.46, 3.69). In conclusion, the association between higher LDL-C and risk of myocardial infarction is weaker for people with lower baseline eGFR, despite higher absolute risk of myocardial infarction. Increased LDL-C may be less useful as a marker of coronary risk among people with CKD than the general population.

AB  - Background: Geriatric conditions may influence outcomes among patients receiving implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). We sought to determine the prevalence of frailty and dementia among older adults receiving primary prevention ICDs and to determine the impact of multimorbidity on mortality within 1 year of ICD implantation.Methods and Results: The cohort included 83 792 Medicare patients from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry ICD Registry who underwent first primary prevention ICD implantation between 2006 and 2009. These data were merged with Medicare analytic files to determine the prevalence of frailty, dementia, and other conditions before ICD implantation, as well as 1-year mortality. A validated claim-based algorithm was used to identify frail patients. Mutually exclusive patterns of chronic conditions were examined. The association of each pattern with 1-year mortality was assessed using logistic regression models adjusted for selected patient characteristics. Approximately 1 in 10 Medicare patients with heart failure receiving a primary prevention ICD had frailty (10%) or dementia (1%). One-year mortality was 22% for patients with frailty, 27% for patients with dementia, and 12% in the overall cohort. Several multimorbidity patterns were associated with high 1-year mortality rates: dementia with frailty (29%), frailty with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (25%), and frailty with diabetes mellitus (23%). These patterns were present in 8% of the cohort.Conclusions: More than 10% of Medicare beneficiaries with heart failure receiving primary prevention ICDs have frailty or dementia. These patients had significantly higher 1-year mortality than those with other common chronic conditions. Frailty and dementia should be considered in clinical decision-making and guideline development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Atenolol and metoprolol tartrate are commonly prescribed [beta]-blockers. Atenolol elimination depends on kidney function, whereas metoprolol tartrate does not. We hypothesized that compared to metoprolol tartrate, initiating oral atenolol treatment would be associated with more adverse events in older adults, with the association most pronounced in patients with lower baseline estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs). STUDY DESIGN: Population-based matched retrospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Older adults (mean age, 75 years) in Ontario, Canada, prescribed oral atenolol versus metoprolol tartrate from April 2002 through December 2011. The 2 groups were well matched (n=75,257 in each group), with no difference in 31 measured baseline characteristics. Patients with end-stage renal disease were ineligible, and 4.6% of patients had chronic kidney disease (median eGFR, 38mL/min/1.73m(2) assessed through a database algorithm). PREDICTORS: [beta]-Blocker type and eGFR. OUTCOMES: A composite outcome of hospitalization with bradycardia or hypotension and all-cause mortality were assessed in 90-day follow-up. RESULTS: Compared to metoprolol tartrate, initiating atenolol treatment was not associated with higher risk of hospitalization with bradycardia or hypotension (incidence, 0.71% vs 0.79%; relative risk, 0.90; 95%CI, 0.80-1.01). Atenolol treatment initiation was associated with lower 90-day risk of mortality than metoprolol tartrate (incidence, 0.97% vs 1.44%; relative risk, 0.68; 95%CI, 0.61-0.74). Lower eGFR did not modify either association (P for interaction=0.5 and 0.6, respectively). LIMITATIONS: Heart rate and blood pressure were not available in our data sources, and effects ascertained from observational studies are subject to residual confounding. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to our expectation, we found that atenolol versus metoprolol tartrate was associated with lower 90-day risk of mortality in patients regardless of eGFR, with no difference in risk of hospitalization with bradycardia or hypotension.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Behavioral stage of change (SoC) algorithms classify patients' readiness for medical treatment decision-making. In the precontemplation stage, patients have no intention to take action within 6 months. In the contemplation stage, action is intended within 6 months. In the preparation stage, patients intend to take action within 30 days. In the action stage, the change has been made. This study examines the influence of SoC on dialysis modality decision-making.Design, Setting, Participants,& Measurements: SoC and relevant covariates were measured, and associations with dialysis decision-making were determined. In-depth interviews were conducted with 16 patients on dialysis to elicit experiences. Qualitative interview data informed the survey design. Surveys were administered to adults with CKD (eGFR≤25 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) from August, 2012 to June, 2013. Multivariable logistic regression modeled dialysis decision-making with predictors: SoC, provider connection, and dialysis knowledge score.Results: Fifty-five patients completed the survey (71% women, 39% white, and 59% black), and median annual income was $17,500. In total, 65% of patients were in the precontemplation/contemplation (thinking) and 35% of patients were in the preparation/maintenance (acting) SoC; 62% of patients had made dialysis modality decisions. Doctors explaining modality options, higher dialysis knowledge scores, and fewer lifestyle barriers were associated with acting versus thinking SoC (all P<0.02). Patients making modality decisions had doctors who explained dialysis options (76% versus 43%), were in the acting versus the thinking SoC (50% versus 10%), had higher dialysis knowledge scores (1.4 versus 0.5), and had lower eGFR (13.9 versus 16.8 ml/min/1.73 m(2); all P<0.05). In adjusted analyses, dialysis knowledge was significantly associated with decision-making (odds ratio, 4.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 12.9; P=0.01), and SoC was of borderline significance (odds ratio, 5.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 32.6; P=0.05). The model C statistic was 0.87.Conclusions: Dialysis decision-making was associated with SoC, dialysis knowledge, and physicians discussing treatment options. Future studies determining ways to assist patients with CKD in making satisfying modality decisions are warranted.

AB  - Background: Hypertensive nephrosclerosis is one of the most frequent causes of chronic kidney failure. Proteome analysis potentially improves the pathophysiological understanding and diagnostic precision of this disorder. In the present exploratory study, we investigated experimental nephrosclerosis in the two-kidney, one-clip (2K1C) hypertensive rat model.Methods: The renal cortex proteome from juxtamedullary cortex and outer cortex of 2K1C male Wistar-Hannover rats (n = 4) was compared with the sham-operated controls (n = 6), using mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics. We combined a high abundant plasma protein depletion strategy with an extended liquid chromatographic gradient to improve peptide and protein identification. Immunohistology was used for independent confirmation of abundance.Results: We identified 1724 proteins, of which 1434 were quantified with at least two unique peptides. Comparative proteomics revealed 608 proteins, including the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β signalling pathway, with different abundances between the non-clipped kidney of hypertensive 2K1C rats and the corresponding kidney of the normotensive controls (P < 0.05, absolute fold change ≥1.5). Among the most significantly altered proteins in the whole cortex were periostin, transgelin, and creatine kinase B-type. Relative abundance of periostin alone allowed clear classification of 2K1C and controls. Enrichment of periostin in 2K1C rats was verified by immunohistology, showing positivity especially around the fibrotic vessels.Conclusion: The proteome is altered in hypertension-induced kidney damage. We propose periostin, especially in combination with transgelin and creatine kinase B-type, as possible proteomic classifier to distinguish hypertensive nephrosclerosis from the normal tissue. This classifier needs to be further validated with respect to early diagnosis of fibrosis, prognosis, and its potential as a novel molecular target for pharmacological interventions.

AB  - Background: The objectives of this study were to identify risk factors for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to lay the basis for risk stratification based on demographic data and health records.Methods and Findings: The design was a matched case-control study. Severe COVID-19 was defined as either a positive nucleic acid test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the national database followed by entry to a critical care unit or death within 28 days or a death certificate with COVID-19 as underlying cause. Up to 10 controls per case matched for sex, age, and primary care practice were selected from the national population register. For this analysis-based on ascertainment of positive test results up to 6 June 2020, entry to critical care up to 14 June 2020, and deaths registered up to 14 June 2020-there were 36,948 controls and 4,272 cases, of which 1,894 (44%) were care home residents. All diagnostic codes from the past 5 years of hospitalisation records and all drug codes from prescriptions dispensed during the past 240 days were extracted. Rate ratios for severe COVID-19 were estimated by conditional logistic regression. In a logistic regression using the age-sex distribution of the national population, the odds ratios for severe disease were 2.87 for a 10-year increase in age and 1.63 for male sex. In the case-control analysis, the strongest risk factor was residence in a care home, with rate ratio 21.4 (95% CI 19.1-23.9, p = 8 × 10-644). Univariate rate ratios for conditions listed by public health agencies as conferring high risk were 2.75 (95% CI 1.96-3.88, p = 6 × 10-9) for type 1 diabetes, 1.60 (95% CI 1.48-1.74, p = 8 × 10-30) for type 2 diabetes, 1.49 (95% CI 1.37-1.61, p = 3 × 10-21) for ischemic heart disease, 2.23 (95% CI 2.08-2.39, p = 4 × 10-109) for other heart disease, 1.96 (95% CI 1.83-2.10, p = 2 × 10-78) for chronic lower respiratory tract disease, 4.06 (95% CI 3.15-5.23, p = 3 × 10-27) for chronic kidney disease, 5.4 (95% CI 4.9-5.8, p = 1 × 10-354) for neurological disease, 3.61 (95% CI 2.60-5.00, p = 2 × 10-14) for chronic liver disease, and 2.66 (95% CI 1.86-3.79, p = 7 × 10-8) for immune deficiency or suppression. Seventy-eight percent of cases and 52% of controls had at least one listed condition (51% of cases and 11% of controls under age 40). Severe disease was associated with encashment of at least one prescription in the past 9 months and with at least one hospital admission in the past 5 years (rate ratios 3.10 [95% CI 2.59-3.71] and 2.75 [95% CI 2.53-2.99], respectively) even after adjusting for the listed conditions. In those without listed conditions, significant associations with severe disease were seen across many hospital diagnoses and drug categories. Age and sex provided 2.58 bits of information for discrimination. A model based on demographic variables, listed conditions, hospital diagnoses, and prescriptions provided an additional 1.07 bits (C-statistic 0.804). A limitation of this study is that records from primary care were not available.Conclusions: We have shown that, along with older age and male sex, severe COVID-19 is strongly associated with past medical history across all age groups. Many comorbidities beyond the risk conditions designated by public health agencies contribute to this. A risk classifier that uses all the information available in health records, rather than only a limited set of conditions, will more accurately discriminate between low-risk and high-risk individuals who may require shielding until the epidemic is over.

AB  - We sought to determine whether persons with intermediate risk factors for cardiovascular disease presenting to an emergency department with chest pain and chronic kidney disease (CKD) were triaged effectively by chest pain units (CPUs). CPUs evaluate patients with intermediate risk and acute chest pain effectively. CKD is a risk factor for poor outcomes once cardiovascular disease has developed. However, current algorithms to risk stratify patients with acute chest pain do not include renal function. A total of 408 patients enrolled previously in the CHEER study of intermediate risk patients with chest pain, assigned randomly to hospitalization or observation in a CPU where an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was available, were included. No difference was found in short-term outcomes of patients including in-hospital death, myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization based on renal function. For the 205 patients randomized to the CPU, the rate of admission to the hospital was significantly higher in the group with CKD compared with the group with normal renal function (68.2 vs 48.2%, P = 0.007). In a multivariate analysis, decreased renal function was not associated with adverse short-term outcomes. On 5 years follow-up, the overall long-term mortality was significantly higher in the group with CKD (14.1% vs 5.5%, P = 0.003). We concluded that CKD is a strong predictor of hospitalization and overall long-term mortality in patients presenting with chest pain to the emergency department. Current risk factor stratification scoring systems should consider CKD as a predictor of increased risk in patients with chest pain.

AB  - Importance: Self-monitoring of blood pressure with self-titration of antihypertensives (self-management) results in lower blood pressure in patients with hypertension, but there are no data about patients in high-risk groups.Objective: To determine the effect of self-monitoring with self-titration of antihypertensive medication compared with usual care on systolic blood pressure among patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease.Design, Setting, and Patients: A primary care, unblinded, randomized clinical trial involving 552 patients who were aged at least 35 years with a history of stroke, coronary heart disease, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease and with baseline blood pressure of at least 130/80 mm Hg being treated at 59 UK primary care practices was conducted between March 2011 and January 2013.Interventions: Self-monitoring of blood pressure combined with an individualized self-titration algorithm. During the study period, the office visit blood pressure measurement target was 130/80 mm Hg and the home measurement target was 120/75 mm Hg. Control patients received usual care consisting of seeing their health care clinician for routine blood pressure measurement and adjustment of medication if necessary.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the difference in systolic blood pressure between intervention and control groups at the 12-month office visit.Results: Primary outcome data were available from 450 patients (81%). The mean baseline blood pressure was 143.1/80.5 mm Hg in the intervention group and 143.6/79.5 mm Hg in the control group. After 12 months, the mean blood pressure had decreased to 128.2/73.8 mm Hg in the intervention group and to 137.8/76.3 mm Hg in the control group, a difference of 9.2 mm Hg (95% CI, 5.7-12.7) in systolic and 3.4 mm Hg (95% CI, 1.8-5.0) in diastolic blood pressure following correction for baseline blood pressure. Multiple imputation for missing values gave similar results: the mean baseline was 143.5/80.2 mm Hg in the intervention group vs 144.2/79.9 mm Hg in the control group, and at 12 months, the mean was 128.6/73.6 mm Hg in the intervention group vs 138.2/76.4 mm Hg in the control group, with a difference of 8.8 mm Hg (95% CI, 4.9-12.7) for systolic and 3.1 mm Hg (95% CI, 0.7-5.5) for diastolic blood pressure between groups. These results were comparable in all subgroups, without excessive adverse events.Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with hypertension at high risk of cardiovascular disease, self-monitoring with self-titration of antihypertensive medication compared with usual care resulted in lower systolic blood pressure at 12 months.Trial Registration: isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN87171227.

AB  - Objective: To help primary care providers, both family physicians and nurse practitioners, identify, detect, and manage patients with and at risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD), as well as outline criteria for appropriate referral to nephrology.Sources Of Information: Published guidelines on the topic of CKD and its comorbidities were reviewed. A MEDLINE search was conducted using the MeSH terms chronic renal insufficiency, family practice, and primary health care. The search was limited to reviews and articles in English. The search covered all relevant articles from 2006 to the present.Main Message: The KidneyWise clinical tool kit, created by the Ontario Renal Network and available at www.kidneywise.ca, provides evidence-informed, practical guidance to primary care providers on the diagnosis and management of CKD. A component of this tool is an algorithm that offers a step-by-step approach to diagnosing and managing CKD. This resource will help empower providers to identify those at high risk of this condition, order appropriate diagnostic tests, help prevent further disease progression, and reduce comorbid cardiovascular risk in patients with CKD.Conclusion: Most patients with CKD can be managed in primary care. Serial follow-up is essential to identify patients at high risk of progression to advanced stages of CKD, including end-stage renal disease. Primary care providers must continue to work together with local nephrologists to improve the lives of those living with CKD.

AB  - Background: Anemia commonly develops in patients with chronic kidney disease and is strongly associated with adverse clinical outcomes. There are currently no published studies evaluating the efficacy of a nurse-driven anemia-management protocol for patients with chronic kidney disease who are not receiving dialysis. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of an anemia-management protocol in terms of achieving hemoglobin and transferrin saturation levels within the target range, as well as associated utilization of medications, relative to individualized dosing of medications by nephrologists. Methods: An algorithm for nurse-driven management of anemia was introduced in April 2009 at a kidney function clinic in a large urban centre. The charts of patients with chronic kidney disease who were not undergoing dialysis were reviewed before (July to December 2007) and after (July to December 2009) implementation of the protocol. Patients' data for hemoglobin, transferrin saturation, and doses of iron and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents were collected for each of the 6-month study periods. Results: In total, 390 patients were treated for anemia before and 434 patients after introduction of the protocol. The anemia-management protocol was non-inferior to individualized dosing for maintenance of hemoglobin levels within the target range of 110-120 g/L: percentage of measured levels within target range 33.3% (485/1456) before versus 34.2% (504/1472) after (absolute difference 0.9 percentage points, 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.5 to 4.4). The criteria for non-inferiority were not met for maintenance of transferrin saturation within the target range of 22%-50%: percentage of levels within target range 58.8% (374/636) before versus 56.9% (403/708) after (absolute difference 1.9 percentage points, 95% CI -3.4 to 7.2). There were no statistically significant differences in mean doses of epoetin alfa, darbepoetin, or iron before and after introduction of the protocol. Similarly, there were no statistically significant differences in number of dose changes for epoetin alfa, darbepoetin, or iron. Conclusion: The nurse-driven anemia-management protocol was non-inferior to dosing by nephrologists in terms of managing hemoglobin levels. It would be reasonable to use an anemia-management protocol for patients with chronic kidney disease who are not receiving dialysis.

AB  - Abstract: Ethnopharmacological relevance: Poria cocos Wolf (Polyporaceae) is a well-known medicinal fungus. The epidermis of the sclerotia (“Fu-Ling-Pi” in Chinese) is used as a diuretic and traditionally used for promoting urination and reduce edema. Aim of the study: Traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) treat many diseases through multi-components, multi-ways and multi-targets. However, the molecular mechanisms of TCM are not yet well understood. In the present work, ultra performance liquid chromatography-based metabonomics analysis was applied to investigate the urinary metabolite profiling of the renoprotective effect of FLP on adenine-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD) rat model and involved possible mechanism. Material and methods: A metabonomic approach based on ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight high-sensitivity mass spectrometry and a novel mass spectrometryElevated Energy data collection technique was developed. The resulting dataset was analyzed by principal component analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis. The identification of all potential biomarkers was performed using reference standard by comparing their mass spectra, MSE fragments information, isotopic pattern and MassLynx i-FIT algorithm. Results: By partial least squares-discriminate analysis, 15 biomarkers in rat urine were identified and 11 of them were related to the pathway of adenine metabolism and amino acid metabolism. Among these biomarkers, eight biomarkers like adenine, l-acetylcarnitine, 8-hydroxyadenine, hypoxanthine, creatine, methionine, phytosphingosine and phenylalanine were reversed to the control level in FLP-treated group and six biomarkers like 2,8-dihydroxyadenine, indole-3-carboxylic acid, 3-methyldioxyindole, ethyl-N 2-acetyl-l-argininate, 3-O-methyldopa and xanthurenic acid were reversed to high control group by FLP, which indicates that the urinary metabolic pattern significantly changed after FLP treatment. Conclusions: Our study indicates that FLP treatment can ameliorate CKD by intervening in some dominating metabolic pathways, such as adenine metabolism and amino acid metabolism. The metabonomic results not only supplied a systematic view of the development and progression of CKD and mechanism studies of FLP but also provided the theoretical basis for the prevention or treatment of CKD.

AB  - Background: Outpatient care is steadily changing from hospital consultations to other platforms, such as phone consultation and online virtual clinics. It is prudent to maintain quality of care with such initiatives. Currently, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have frequent scheduled visits, but it may be possible to optimise the frequency of hospital consultations using information from patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires filled in at home (PRO-based follow-up). This approach may provide a more individually tailored follow-up based on actual needs for clinical attention. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the quality of care, use of resources and patient outcomes associated with PRO-based follow-up in patients with CKD.Methods: This study is a pragmatic, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial in outpatients with CKD (Grove BE et al., Qual Life Res 27: S143, 2018). Newly referred patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≤40 ml/min 1.73m2 will be randomised to either: 1. PRO-based remote follow-up 2. PRO-based telephone consultation 3. Usual outpatient follow-up (control group) In the two intervention groups, a diagnosis-specific PRO questionnaire completed by the patient at home will substitute for usual outpatient follow-up visits. The PRO questionnaire will in part be used as a screening tool to identify patients in need of outpatient contact and to identify focus areas. Responses from the questionnaire will be processed according to a disease-specific algorithm and assigned green, yellow or red status according to patients' needs. The primary outcome will be loss of renal function evaluated by eGFR. Secondary outcomes are 1. Clinical outcomes, including initiation of acute dialyses, hospitalisation and mortality, 2. Utilisation of healthcare resources and 3. PRO measures, primarily quality of life (Euroqol EQ-5D) and illness perception (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ).Discussion: Benefits and possible drawbacks of the PRO-based follow-up will be evaluated. If PRO-based follow-up proves non-inferior to usual outpatient follow-up, a reorganisation of routine clinical practice in nephrology outpatient clinics may occur. Further, results may impact other patient groups with chronic conditions attending regular follow-up.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03847766 (Retrospectively registered on January 23, 2019).

AB  - In many series of diabetic foot ulcer care, heel ulcers greater than 4 cm across have been identified as an independent predictor of limb loss. Therefore, we set out to pursue the most aggressive limb salvage algorithm in patients with heel ulcers greater than 4 cm in diameter. Over 5 years, we identified 21 patients, 39DS84 years of age, all with diabetes mellitus, with heel ulcers greater than 4 cm in diameter and had magnetic resonance imaging or bone scan evidence of osteomyelitis. Seven of the 21 patients had end-stage renal disease defined as being haemodialysis dependent. All patients had ankle brachial indices <0?4 or monophasic pulse volume recordings. All patients underwent distal bypass surgery with vein. After adequate perfusion was obtained, all patients underwent partial calcanectomy and intra-operative negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) placement. This was followed by treatment with recombinant platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). One patient underwent amputation during the healing process secondary to ongoing sepsis. Twenty of 21 patients healed acutely (within 6 months). Three of 20 patients went on to subsequent below knee amputation within 12 months of healing primarily. At 2 years, 12 of 21 (57%) were ambulating independently, 1 of 21 was dead, 4 of 21 had undergone amputation, 4 (19%) had limbs that were intact but were not ambulating. A total limb salvage rate of 76% at 2 years mirrored the secondary patency rates, with 100% follow up. Heel ulcers require multimodality therapy if they are going to have any chance to heal. We believe the algorithm presented allows for the required revascularisation and a modulation of the heel ulcer microenvironment by augmenting the microcirculation through NPWT, and improving the proliferative capacity with PDGF.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study is to analyze and visualize blood pressure (BP) patterns during continuous hemodialysis (HD) sessions, referred to as multiple-session patterns (MSPs), and explore whether deep learning models with MSPs have better performance.Material and Methods: Data from 3.79 million hemodialysis BP records collected from July 30, 2007, to August 25, 2016, were obtained from the health system's electronic health records. We analyzed BP patterns during 36 continuous HD sessions (approximately 3 months) and selected 1311 (survival: 1246; death: 65) end-stage renal disease patients to classify 1-year outcomes (survival or death). Convolution kernels of different sizes were used to construct convolutional neural networks to recognize MSPs and BP patterns during a single HD session, referred to as single-session patterns (SSPs). BP patterns corresponded to convolution kernels and were represented and visualized as the input patches that activate the feature maps most. We used global average pooling (GAP) to measure the overall response of the inputs to each convolution kernel (pattern). The weights of the fully connected layers after GAP can measure the correlations between the convolution kernels (patterns) and the classification results. We solved the problem of data imbalance with a two-phase training strategy.Results: The F1_score was 0.782 ± 0.058 (95% CI) in the models with SSPs and was approximately 19.5% higher (0.977 ± 0.014, 95% CI) in the models with MSPs.Conclusions: The results indicated that consistent with previous studies, patients with lower BPs and longer HD sessions have better prognoses. BP patterns during continuous HD sessions can represent patients' 1-year mortality risk better than BP patterns during a single HD session and therefore improve the performance of prediction models.

AB  - Objective: To ascertain if outpatients with moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) had their condition documented in their notes in the electronic health record (EHR).Design: Outpatients with CKD were selected based on a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate and their notes extracted from the Columbia University data warehouse. Two lexical-based classification tools (classifier and word-counter) were developed to identify documentation of CKD in electronic notes.Measurements: The tools categorized patients' individual notes on the basis of the presence of CKD-related terms. Patients were categorized as appropriately documented if their notes contained reference to CKD when CKD was present.Results: The sensitivities of the classifier and word-count methods were 95.4% and 99.8%, respectively. The specificity of both was 99.8%. Categorization of individual patients as appropriately documented was 96.9% accurate. Of 107 patients with manually verified moderate CKD, 32 (22%) lacked appropriate documentation. Patients whose CKD had not been appropriately documented were significantly less likely to be on renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or have urine protein quantified, and had the illness for half as long (15.1 vs 30.7 months; p<0.01) compared to patients with documentation.Conclusion: Our studies show that lexical-based classification tools can accurately ascertain if appropriate documentation of CKD is present in a EHR. Using this method, we demonstrated under-documentation of patients with moderate CKD. Under-documented patients were less likely to receive CKD guideline recommended care. A tool that prompts providers to document CKD might shorten the time to implementing guideline-based recommendations.

AB  - Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a progressive kidney disease, a well-known complication of long-standing diabetes. DN is the most frequent reason for dialysis in many Western countries. Early detection may enable development of specific drugs and early initiation of therapy, thereby postponing/preventing the need for renal replacement therapy. We evaluated urinary proteome analysis as a tool for prediction of DN. Capillary electrophoresis-coupled mass spectrometry was used to profile the low-molecular weight proteome in urine. We examined urine samples from a longitudinal cohort of type 1 and 2 diabetic patients (n = 35) using a previously generated chronic kidney disease (CKD) biomarker classifier to assess peptides of collected urines for signs of DN. The application of this classifier to samples of normoalbuminuric subjects up to 5 years prior to development of macroalbuminuria enabled early detection of subsequent progression to macroalbuminuria (area under the curve [AUC] 0.93) compared with urinary albumin routinely used to determine the diagnosis (AUC 0.67). Statistical analysis of each urinary CKD biomarker depicted its regulation with respect to diagnosis of DN over time. Collagen fragments were prominent biomarkers 3-5 years before onset of macroalbuminuria. Before albumin excretion starts to increase, there is a decrease in collagen fragments. Urinary proteomics enables noninvasive assessment of DN risk at an early stage via determination of specific collagen fragments.

AB  - Background: The primary approach for defining disease in observational healthcare databases is to construct phenotype algorithms (PAs), rule-based heuristics predicated on the presence, absence, and temporal logic of clinical observations. However, a complete evaluation of PAs, i.e., determining sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV), is rarely performed. In this study, we propose a tool (PheValuator) to efficiently estimate a complete PA evaluation.Methods: We used 4 administrative claims datasets: OptumInsight's de-identified Clinformatics™ Datamart (Eden Prairie,MN); IBM MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid); IBM MarketScan Medicare Supplemental Beneficiaries; and IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters from 2000 to 2017. Using PheValuator involves (1) creating a diagnostic predictive model for the phenotype, (2) applying the model to a large set of randomly selected subjects, and (3) comparing each subject's predicted probability for the phenotype to inclusion/exclusion in PAs. We used the predictions as a 'probabilistic gold standard' measure to classify positive/negative cases. We examined 4 phenotypes: myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, chronic kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. We examined several PAs for each phenotype including 1-time (1X) occurrence of the diagnosis code in the subject's record and 1-time occurrence of the diagnosis in an inpatient setting with the diagnosis code as the primary reason for admission (1X-IP-1stPos).Results: Across phenotypes, the 1X PA showed the highest sensitivity/lowest PPV among all PAs. 1X-IP-1stPos yielded the highest PPV/lowest sensitivity. Specificity was very high across algorithms. We found similar results between algorithms across datasets.Conclusion: PheValuator appears to show promise as a tool to estimate PA performance characteristics.

AB  - Optimal treatment algorithms for erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) and iron therapy in anemic CKD patients are lacking. Kuragano et al. evaluated hemodialysis patients over two years and report increased mortality risk and/or adverse events in those with high serum ferritin levels and high ferritin fluctuations, and an increase in adverse events in iron users. Clinical practice should avoid disproportionately high ESA or iron doses to achieve hemoglobin targets, particularly in those with significant comorbidity or ESA resistance.

AB  - An open research question when leveraging ontological knowledge is when to treat different concepts separately from each other and when to aggregate them. For instance, concepts for the terms "paroxysmal cough" and "nocturnal cough" might be aggregated in a kidney disease study, but should be left separate in a pneumonia study. Determining whether two concepts are similar enough to be aggregated can help build better datasets for data mining purposes and avoid signal dilution. Quantifying the similarity among concepts is a difficult task, however, in part because such similarity is context-dependent. We propose a comprehensive method, which computes a similarity score for a concept pair by combining data-driven and ontology-driven knowledge. We demonstrate our method on concepts from SNOMED-CT and on a corpus of clinical notes of patients with chronic kidney disease. By combining information from usage patterns in clinical notes and from ontological structure, the method can prune out concepts that are simply related from those which are semantically similar. When evaluated against a list of concept pairs annotated for similarity, our method reaches an AUC (area under the curve) of 92%.

AB  - Algorithms for identifying patients of interest from observational data must address missing and inaccurate data and are desired to achieve comparable performance on both administrative claims and electronic health records data. However, administrative claims data do not contain the necessary information to develop accurate algorithms for disorders that require laboratory results, and this omission can result in insensitive diagnostic code-based algorithms. In this paper, we tested our assertion that the performance of a diagnosis code-based algorithm for chronic kidney disorder (CKD) can be improved by adding other codes indirectly related to CKD (e.g., codes for dialysis, kidney transplant, suspicious kidney disorders). Following the best practices from Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), we adapted an electronic health record-based gold standard algorithm for CKD and then created algorithms that can be executed on administrative claims data and account for related data quality issues. We externally validated our algorithms on four electronic health record datasets in the OHDSI network. Compared to the algorithm that uses CKD diagnostic codes only, positive predictive value of the algorithms that use additional codes was slightly increased (47.4% vs. 47.9-48.5% respectively). The algorithms adapted from the gold standard algorithm can be used to infer chronic kidney disorder based on administrative claims data. We succeeded in improving the generalizability and consistency of the CKD phenotypes by using data and vocabulary standardized across the OHDSI network, although performance variability across datasets remains. We showed that identifying and addressing coding and data heterogeneity can improve the performance of the algorithms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medicare claims data might provide an efficient source for outcomes research in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, in the absence of laboratory data, one would need to identify patients with CKD from diagnosis codes associated with health care claims. The validity of this approach to identify patients with CKD has not been sufficiently studied. METHODS: From chart abstraction, we obtained the first serum creatinine measurement of 1,852 elderly Medicare beneficiaries upon hospitalization for myocardial infarction and estimated each patient's glomerular filtration rate. We then searched all Medicare claims of the preceding year for the presence of a diagnosis code for diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephropathy, chronic renal insufficiency, acute renal failure, and miscellaneous other renal diseases. Using the gold standard of an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (<1.00 mL/s/1.73 m2) for definition of CKD, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for each of these diagnoses and combinations of these diagnoses. RESULTS: The sensitivity of individual diagnosis algorithms ranged from 2.7% for diabetic nephropathy to 17.5% for miscellaneous. However, miscellaneous had a lower specificity (95.5%) than all other individual diagnosis algorithms (all > or =99%). Using combinations of these algorithms improved sensitivity up to 26.6%, but at the cost of lower specificity. Positive predictive values generally were high (85.7% to 97.5%), but negative predictive values were low (32.4% to 37.4%). Conclusion: High positive predictive values indicate that Medicare claims data can be used to accurately identify patients with CKD for study. However, the utility of such databases for comparison of patients with CKD versus lesser degrees of CKD is limited. Copyright © 2005 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common, but more than 30% of people with CKD are referred late, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. An updated classification of CKD, using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) allows the severity of CKD to be determined and when it is appropriate to refer to a consultant nephrologist. New approaches to the measurement of protein excretion are stressed with particular reference to using urine albumin:creatinine ratio or urine protein:creatinine ratio. Annual measurement of serum creatinine in at-risk patients is clearly outlined as are the indications for renal ultrasound examination. Two algorithms for the management of newly detected abnormal eGFR and for the management of CKD, Stages 3--5, are not in the NICE Guideline No 73 document but reflect the author's clinical experience of working in this area, with the aim of simplifying these two important topics. The safe use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin blocking agents in the everyday clinical work place is outlined. The management of CKD due to diabetic nephropathy and hypertension is an important part of diabetes management and this review of NICE Guideline No 73 on the early identification and management of CKD in adults in both primary and secondary care settings will further enable the better care of type 1 and type 2 diabetic subjects with renal impairment.

AB  - Treatment for chronic viral hepatitis C has advanced dramatically to current standard of care all-oral direct-acting antiviral regimens with relatively short treatment duration and high efficacy. Patients with comorbid end-stage renal disease have constituted a "special patient population" with data and treatment options lagging behind that of the broader population of patients with chronic hepatitis C until recently. Herein we review the current evidence base for direct-acting antiviral therapy in this population. We provide a suggested algorithm for the evaluation of such patients for therapy. We highlight special considerations in regards to the choice of regimen, duration, and timing in regards to potential kidney transplantation.

AB  - Background: Early diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major challenge in the intensive care unit (ICU). The AKIpredictor is a set of machine-learning-based prediction models for AKI using routinely collected patient information, and accessible online. In order to evaluate its clinical value, the AKIpredictor was compared to physicians' predictions.Methods: Prospective observational study in five ICUs of a tertiary academic center. Critically ill adults without end-stage renal disease or AKI upon admission were considered for enrollment. Using structured questionnaires, physicians were asked upon admission, on the first morning, and after 24 h to predict the development of AKI stages 2 or 3 (AKI-23) during the first week of ICU stay. Discrimination, calibration, and net benefit of physicians' predictions were compared against the ones by the AKIpredictor.Results: Two hundred fifty-two patients were included, 30 (12%) developed AKI-23. In the cohort of patients with predictions by physicians and AKIpredictor, the performance of physicians and AKIpredictor were respectively upon ICU admission, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) 0.80 [0.69-0.92] versus 0.75 [0.62-0.88] (n = 120, P = 0.25) with net benefit in ranges 0-26% versus 0-74%; on the first morning, AUROC 0.94 [0.89-0.98] versus 0.89 [0.82-0.97] (n = 187, P = 0.27) with main net benefit in ranges 0-10% versus 0-48%; after 24 h, AUROC 0.95 [0.89-1.00] versus 0.89 [0.79-0.99] (n = 89, P = 0.09) with main net benefit in ranges 0-67% versus 0-50%.Conclusions: The machine-learning-based AKIpredictor achieved similar discriminative performance as physicians for prediction of AKI-23, and higher net benefit overall, because physicians overestimated the risk of AKI. This suggests an added value of the systematic risk stratification by the AKIpredictor to physicians' predictions, in particular to select high-risk patients or reduce false positives in studies evaluating new and potentially harmful therapies. Due to the low event rate, future studies are needed to validate these findings.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03574896 registration date: July 2nd, 2018.

AB  - Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a frequent cause of kidney failure; however, urinary biomarkers for the disease are lacking. In a step towards identifying such markers, we used multidimensional-multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy with support vector machine-based classification and analyzed urine specimens of 54 patients with ADPKD and slightly reduced estimated glomerular filtration rates. Within this cohort, 35 received medication for arterial hypertension and 19 did not. The results were compared with NMR profiles of 46 healthy volunteers, 10 ADPKD patients on hemodialysis with residual renal function, 16 kidney transplant patients, and 52 type 2 diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease. Based on the average of 51 out of 701 NMR features, we could reliably discriminate ADPKD patients with moderately advanced disease from ADPKD patients with end-stage renal disease, patients with chronic kidney disease of other etiologies, and healthy probands with an accuracy of >80%. Of the 35 patients with ADPKD receiving medication for hypertension, most showed increased excretion of proteins and also methanol. In contrast, elevated urinary methanol was not found in any of the control and other patient groups. Thus, we found that NMR fingerprinting of urine differentiates ADPKD from several other kidney diseases and individuals with normal kidney function. The diagnostic and prognostic potential of these profiles requires further evaluation.

AB  - Background: The choice of the most appropriate antithrombotic regimen that balances ischemic and bleeding risks was addressed by the August 2017 European Society of Cardiologists (ESC)/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery Focused Update recommendations, which propose new evaluation scores and protocols for patients requiring a coronary stent or patients with an acute coronary syndrome, atrial fibrillation, or a high bleeding risk and indication for oral anticoagulation therapy.Discussion: Numerous questions remain regarding antithrombotic regimens and risk management algorithms for both ischemic and hemorrhagic events in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in various clinical scenarios. Limitations of current studies include a general ack of advanced CKD patients in major randomized controlled trials, of evidence on algorithm implementation, and of robust assessment tools for hemorrhagic risk. Herein, we aim to analyze the ESC Update recommendations and the newly implemented risk scores (DAPT, PRECISE-DAPT, PARIS) from the point of view of CKD, providing suggestions on drug choice (which combination has the best evidence), dosage, and duration (the same or different as for non-CKD population) of antithrombotics, as well as to identify current shortcomings and to envision directions of future research.Conclusion: We provide an evidence-based perspective on the new proposed bleeding management protocol, with focus on the CKD population. Despite previous important steps on antithrombotic therapy of renal patients, there remain many unsolved questions for which our suggestions could fundament new randomized controlled trials and specific protocols.

AB  - Background: Hemodialysis mainly relies on the "artificial kidney," which plays a very important role in temporarily or permanently substituting for the kidney to carry out the exchange of waste and discharge of water. Nevertheless, a previous study on the artificial kidney has paid little attention to the optimization of factors and levels for reducing the solidification of the artificial kidney during the hemodialysis procedure. Thus, this study proposes an integrated model that uses the Taguchi method, omega formula, and back-propagation network to determine the optimal factors and levels for addressing this issue.Methods: First, we collected the recommendations of medical doctors and nursing staff through a small group discussion, and used the Taguchi method to analyze the key factors at different levels. Next, the omega formula was used to convert the analysis results from the Taguchi method to assess the defect rate. Finally, we utilized back-propagation network algorithms to predict the optimal factors and levels for artificial kidney solidification, in order to confirm that the key factors and levels identified can effectively improve the solidification rate of the artificial kidney and thereby enhance the effect of hemodialysis.Results: The research finding proposes the following as the optimal factors and levels for artificial kidney solidification: the amount of anticoagulation should be set at 500 units, the velocity of blood flow at 300 ml/min, the dehydration volume at 2.5 kg, and the vascular access type as autologous blood vessels. We obtained 270 sets of data from the patients of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) under the setting of the optimal combination of the factors at different levels; the defect rate of artificial kidney solidification is 12.9%, which is better than the defect rate of 32% in the original experiment. Meanwhile, the patient characteristics for physiological status in BMI, serum calcium, hematocrit, ferritin, and transferrin saturation percentage are improved by this study.Conclusion: This conclusion validates the ability of the proposed model in this study to improve the solidification rate of the artificial kidney, thereby confirming the model's use as a standard operation procedure in the hemodialysis experiment. The ideas behind and the implications of the proposed model are further discussed in this study.

AB  - Nephrology nurses who manage the anemia of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are often responsible, for monitoring assessing, and intervening to maintain hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels within their facility target range. Consistency in anemia-related outcomes is sometimes compromised when patients exhibit hyporesponse to Epoetin alfa therapy--defined as a temporary or chronic Hb/Hct level below the target range. Early detection of hyporesponse and correction of conditions that are affecting erythrocyte development can sometimes be delayed if clinicians are unable to promptly identify a causative etiology. This article reviews a hyporesponse algorithm worksheet that nurses can use to identify the cause(s) of hyporesponse and guide clinical decision making.

AB  - Objective: In North America, tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) disease rates associated with antitumour necrosis factor α (anti-TNFα) therapy are unknown.Methods: At Kaiser Permanente Northern California, the authors searched automated pharmacy records to identify inflammatory disease patients who received anti-TNF therapy during 2000-2008 and used validated electronic search algorithms to identify NTM and tuberculosis cases occurring during anti-TNF drug exposure.Results: Of 8418 anti-TNF users identified, 60% had rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Among anti-TNF users, 18 developed NTM and 16 tuberculosis after drug start. Anti-TNF associated rates of NTM and tuberculosis were 74 (95% CI: 37 to 111) and 49 (95% CI: 18 to 79) per 100 000 person-years, respectively. Rates (per 100, 000 person-years) for NTM and tuberculosis respectively for etanercept were 35 (95% CI: 1 to 69) and 17 (95% CI: 0 to 41); infliximab, 116 (95% CI: 30 to 203) and 83 (95% CI: 10 to 156); and adalimumab, 122 (95% CI: 3 to 241) and 91 (95% CI: 19 to 267). Background rates for NTM and tuberculosis in unexposed RA-patients were 19.2 (14.2 to 25.0) and 8.7 (5.3 to 13.2), and in the general population were 4.1 (95% CI 3.9 to 4.4) and 2.8 (95% CI 2.6 to 3.0) per 100, 000 person-years. Among anti-TNF users, compared with uninfected individuals, NTM case-patients were older (median age 68 vs 50 years, p<0.01) and more likely to have RA (100% vs 60%, p<0.01); whereas, tuberculosis case-patients were more likely to have diabetes (37% vs 16%, p=0.02) or chronic renal disease (25% vs 6%, p=0.02).Conclusions: Among anti-TNF users in USA, mycobacterial disease rates are elevated, and NTM is associated with RA.

AB  - Care of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) has changed during the past 30 years. Tools to control hyperglycemia have improved and it was shown that improvement in glycemic control diminished the risk of late diabetic complications, including nephropathy. Moreover, in patients with impaired renal function, aggressive treatment of hypertension and renoprotective blockade of the renin-angiotensin system were shown to postpone end-stage renal disease (ESRD), albeit for a short while. Despite these achievements, the incidence of ESRD caused by T1D in the US population has not decreased but rather has increased over the past 20 years, although it now occurs at slightly older ages. This state of affairs is a call to action. This should begin with adopting a new model of diabetic nephropathy in human beings. In that model, instead of microalbuminuria or proteinuria, the focus should be on diagnosis and treatment of progressive renal function decline that leads to ESRD. Such a model has received significant support in clinical and epidemiologic studies. Investigation of mechanisms of such progressive renal function decline should help in the identification of new therapeutic targets and the development of new interventions. To evaluate these interventions, accurate diagnostic algorithms are needed so T1D patients will be stratified according to time to onset to ESRD. Consistent with concepts of personalized medicine, the new interventions should be tailored to and evaluated in patients predicted to have rapid, moderate, or even slow progression to ESRD.

AB  - Abstract A strong correlation exists between improved blood glucose control, obtained from the earliest stages of diabetes, and the prevention of complications. However, tight glycometabolic control does not always translate into an advantage for every patient. Because the characteristics of individual patients play an important role in diabetes care, there is a need to develop personalized action plans. This article suggests tailored therapeutic algorithms for some of the commonest type 2 diabetes phenotypes, taking into consideration age, body mass index, presence of micro- and macrovascular complications, hypoglycemia risk, and the co-existence of chronic renal failure. Particular emphasis is placed on exploiting information supplied through the rational use of self-monitoring of blood glucose as a tool for optimizing diabetes management, according to the prevalence of fasting/preprandial or postprandial hyperglycemia.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Current US guideline statements regarding primary and secondary cardiovascular risk prediction and prevention use absolute risk estimates to identify patients who are at high risk for vascular disease events and who may benefit from specific preventive interventions. These guidelines do not explicitly include patients with stroke, however. This statement provides an overview of evidence and arguments supporting (1) the inclusion of patients with stroke, and atherosclerotic stroke in particular, among those considered to be at high absolute risk of cardiovascular disease and (2) the inclusion of stroke as part of the outcome cluster in risk prediction instruments for vascular disease.Methods and Results: Writing group members were nominated by the committee co-chairs on the basis of their previous work in relevant topic areas and were approved by the American Heart Association (AHA) Stroke Council's Scientific Statements Oversight Committee and the AHA Manuscript Oversight Committee. The writers used systematic literature reviews (covering the period from January 1980 to March 2010), reference to previously published guidelines, personal files, and expert opinion to summarize existing evidence, indicate gaps in current knowledge, and, when appropriate, formulate recommendations using standard AHA criteria. All members of the writing group had the opportunity to comment on the recommendations and approved the final version of this document. The guideline underwent extensive AHA internal peer review, Stroke Council leadership review, and Scientific Statements Oversight Committee review before consideration and approval by the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee. There are several reasons to consider stroke patients, and particularly patients with atherosclerotic stroke, among the groups of patients at high absolute risk of coronary and cardiovascular disease. First, evidence suggests that patients with ischemic stroke are at high absolute risk of fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction or sudden death, approximating the ≥20% absolute risk over 10 years that has been used in some guidelines to define coronary risk equivalents. Second, inclusion of atherosclerotic stroke would be consistent with the reasons for inclusion of diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and other atherosclerotic disorders despite an absence of uniformity of evidence of elevated risks across all populations or patients. Third, the large-vessel atherosclerotic subtype of ischemic stroke shares pathophysiological mechanisms with these other disorders. Inclusion of stroke as a high-risk condition could result in an expansion of ≈10% in the number of patients considered to be at high risk. However, because of the heterogeneity of stroke, it is uncertain whether other stroke subtypes, including hemorrhagic and nonatherosclerotic ischemic stroke subtypes, should be considered to be at the same high levels of risk, and further research is needed. Inclusion of stroke with myocardial infarction and sudden death among the outcome cluster of cardiovascular events in risk prediction instruments, moreover, is appropriate because of the impact of stroke on morbidity and mortality, the similarity of many approaches to prevention of stroke and these other forms of vascular disease, and the importance of stroke relative to coronary disease in some subpopulations. Non-US guidelines often include stroke patients among others at high cardiovascular risk and include stroke as a relevant outcome along with cardiac end points.Conclusions: Patients with atherosclerotic stroke should be included among those deemed to be at high risk (≥20% over 10 years) of further atherosclerotic coronary events. Inclusion of nonatherosclerotic stroke subtypes remains less certain. For the purposes of primary prevention, ischemic stroke should be included among cardiovascular disease outcomes in absolute risk assessment algorithms. The inclusion of atherosclerotic ischemic stroke as a high-risk condition and the inclusion of ischemic stroke more broadly as an outcome will likely have important implications for prevention of cardiovascular disease, because the number of patients considered to be at high risk would grow substantially.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of moderate to severe cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients is more than double the prevalence in the general population. This study describes cognitive impairment occurrence in a peritoneal dialysis cohort compared with a cohort without chronic kidney disease (CKD).Study Design: Cross-sectional study.Setting& Participants: 51 English-speaking peritoneal dialysis patients from 2 urban dialysis units compared with 338 hemodialysis patients from 16 urban dialysis units and 101 voluntary controls without CKD from urban general medicine clinics.Predictor: 45-minute battery of 9 validated neuropsychological tests (cognitive domains memory, executive function, and language).Outcomes: Mild, moderate, or severe cognitive impairment, classified according to a previously designed algorithm.Results: Of the peritoneal dialysis cohort, 33.3% had no or mild, 35.3% had moderate, and 31.4% had severe cognitive impairment; corresponding values were 60.4%, 26.7%, and 12.9% of the non-CKD cohort and 26.6%, 36.4%, and 37.0% of the hemodialysis cohort. A logistic regression model including age, sex, race, education, hemoglobin level, diabetes, and stroke showed that only nonwhite race (P = 0.002) and low education (P = 0.002) were associated with moderate to severe cognitive impairment in the peritoneal dialysis cohort. Compared with hemodialysis patients, more peritoneal dialysis patients had moderate to severe memory impairment (58% vs 51%), but fewer had impaired executive function (one-third vs one-half). Peritoneal dialysis was associated with a more than 2.5-fold increased risk of moderate to severe global cognitive impairment compared with no CKD (OR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.02-6.53), as was hemodialysis (OR, 3.16; 95% CI, 1.91-5.24), in an adjusted logistic regression model.Limitations: Small sample size, participation rate somewhat low.Conclusions: Similar to hemodialysis patients, two-thirds of peritoneal dialysis patients had moderate to severe cognitive impairment, enough to interfere with safely self-administering dialysis and adhering to complex medication regimens. These patients could benefit from cognitive assessment before and periodically after dialysis therapy initiation.

AB  - Key Points: Question: What is the magnitude of female underrepresentation in clinical studies? Findings: In this cross-sectional study, machine reading to extract sex data from 43 135 published articles and 13 165 clinical trial records showed substantial underrepresentation of female participants, with studies as measurement unit, in 7 of 11 disease categories, especially HIV/AIDS, chronic kidney diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. Sex bias in articles for all categories combined was unchanged over time with studies as the measurement unit but improved with participants as measurement unit. Meaning: This study suggests that sex bias against female participants in clinical studies persists, but results differ when studies vs participants are the measurement units. This cross-sectional study uses machine reading to estimate the magnitude of female underrepresentation in clinical studies worldwide. Importance: Analyses of female representation in clinical studies have been limited in scope and scale. Objective: To perform a large-scale analysis of global enrollment sex bias in clinical studies. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, clinical studies from published articles from PubMed from 1966 to 2018 and records from Aggregate Analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov from 1999 to 2018 were identified. Global disease prevalence was determined for male and female patients in 11 disease categories from the Global Burden of Disease database: cardiovascular, diabetes, digestive, hepatitis (types A, B, C, and E), HIV/AIDS, kidney (chronic), mental, musculoskeletal, neoplasms, neurological, and respiratory (chronic). Machine reading algorithms were developed that extracted sex data from tables in articles and records on December 31, 2018, at an artificial intelligence research institute. Male and female participants in 43 135 articles (792 004 915 participants) and 13 165 records (12 977 103 participants) were included. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sex bias was defined as the difference between the fraction of female participants in study participants minus prevalence fraction of female participants for each disease category. A total of 1000 bootstrap estimates of sex bias were computed by resampling individual studies with replacement. Sex bias was reported as mean and 95% bootstrap confidence intervals from articles and records in each disease category over time (before or during 1993 to 2018), with studies or participants as the measurement unit. Results: There were 792 004 915 participants, including 390 470 834 female participants (49%), in articles and 12 977 103 participants, including 6 351 619 female participants (49%), in records. With studies as measurement unit, substantial female underrepresentation (sex bias ≤ −0.05) was observed in 7 of 11 disease categories, especially HIV/AIDS (mean for articles, −0.17 [95% CI, −0.18 to −0.16]), chronic kidney diseases (mean, −0.17 [95% CI, −0.17 to −0.16]), and cardiovascular diseases (mean, −0.14 [95% CI, −0.14 to −0.13]). Sex bias in articles for all categories combined was unchanged over time with studies as measurement unit (range, −0.15 [95% CI, −0.16 to −0.13] to −0.10 [95% CI, −0.14 to −0.06]), but improved from before or during 1993 (mean, −0.11 [95% CI, −0.16 to −0.05]) to 2014 to 2018 (mean, −0.05 [95% CI, −0.09 to −0.02]) with participants as the measurement unit. Larger study size was associated with greater female representation. Conclusions and Relevance: Automated extraction of the number of participants in clinical reports provides an effective alternative to manual analysis of demographic bias. Despite legal and policy initiatives to increase female representation, sex bias against female participants in clinical studies persists. Studies with more participants have greater female representation. Differences between sex bias estimates with studies vs participants as measurement unit, and between articles vs records, suggest that sex bias with both measures and data sources should be reported.

AB  - Objective: Chronic renal insufficiency and/or proteinuria in type 2 diabetes may stem from chronic renal diseases (CKD) other than classic diabetic nephropathy in more than one-third of patients. We interrogated urine proteomic profiles generated by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight/mass spectrometry with the aim of isolating a set of biomarkers able to reliably identify biopsy-proven diabetic nephropathy and to establish a stringent correlation with the different patterns of renal injury.Research Design and Methods: Ten micrograms of urine proteins from 190 subjects (20 healthy subjects, 20 normoalbuminuric, and 18 microalbuminuric diabetic patients and 132 patients with biopsy-proven nephropathy: 65 diabetic nephropathy, 10 diabetic with nondiabetic CKD [nd-CKD], and 57 nondiabetic with CKD) were run using a CM10 ProteinChip array and analyzed by supervised learning methods (Classification and Regression Tree analysis).Results: The classification model correctly identified 75% of patients with normoalbuminuria, 87.5% of those with microalbuminuria, and 87.5% of those with diabetic nephropathy when applied to a blinded testing set. Most importantly, it was able to reliably differentiate diabetic nephropathy from nd-CKD in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Among the best predictors of the classification model, we identified and validated two proteins, ubiquitin and β2-microglobulin.Conclusions: Our data suggest the presence of a specific urine proteomic signature able to reliably identify type 2 diabetic patients with diabetic glomerulosclerosis.

AB  - Prediction of cardiovascular (CV) complications represents the Achilles' heel of end-stage renal disease. Surrogate markers of endothelial dysfunction have been advocated as predictors of CV risk in this cohort of patients. We have recently adapted a noninvasive laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) functional testing of endothelium-dependent microvascular reactivity and demonstrated that end-stage renal disease patients are characterized by profound alterations in thermal hyperemic responsiveness. We hypothesized that such functional assessment of the cutaneous microcirculation may offer a valid, noninvasive test of the severity of endothelial dysfunction and CV risk. To test this hypothesis, we performed a cross-sectional study, in which we compared LDF measurements to conventional risk factors, and performed a pilot longitudinal study. LDF studies were performed in 70 patients and 33 controls. Framingham and Cardiorisk scores were near equivalent for low-risk patients, but more divergent as risk increased. C reactive protein (CRP) levels and LDF parameters (amplitude of thermal hyperemia (TH), area under the curve of TH) showed significant abnormality in high-risk vs low-risk patients calculated using either Framingham or Cardiorisk scores. Patients who had abnormal LDF parameters showed increased CV mortality, however, had similar risk assessments (Framingham, Cardiorisk, CRP, and homocysteine) to those with unimpaired LDF tracings. In conclusion, LDF parameters of microvascular reactivity offer a sensitive characterization of endothelial dysfunction, which may improve CV risk assessment through incorporation into the Framingham or Cardiorisk algorithm.

AB  - Background: Chronic paranasal sinusitis (CPS) has been known as a surrogate marker for granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). We investigated whether CPS at diagnosis may have an influence on the classification and outcomes of microscopic polyangiitis (MPA).Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 106 immunosuppressive drug-naïve patients with MPA. We compared variables at diagnosis of MPA patients with CPS with either MPA patients without CPS or 29 GPA patients with CPS. We applied the algorithm for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) proposed by the European Medicine Agency to 22 MPA patients with CPS and reclassify them. Death, relapse and end-stage renal disease were assessed as the poor outcomes.Results: Except for ENT manifestations, only pulmonary manifestation was more frequently observed in MPA patients with CPS than those without (77.3% vs 47.6%). No proteinase 3-ANCA was detected in all MPA patients with CPS. Meanwhile, general (63.6% vs 27.6%) and renal manifestations (81.8% vs 44.8%) more often developed in MPA patients with CPS than GPA patients with CPS. Of 22 MPA patients with CPS, 21 patients underwent biopsies. When CPS was not considered as a surrogate marker for GPA, all patients with CPS were reclassified as MPA. Ground glass opacity and reticulation on high-resolution computed tomography and renal vasculitis were helpful clues supporting the classification of MPA in patients with CPS. CPS at diagnosis was not associated with the outcomes of MPA.Conclusion: CPS might not be a sufficient surrogate marker for GPA in the classification of AAV.

AB  - Vascular access remains the Achilles heel of end-stage renal disease patients, receiving haemodialysis. The increase in the number of elderly dialysis patients with additional cardiovascular co-morbidities and diabetes mellitus makes the creation and maintenance of functioning vascular access, more difficult and cumbersome. Therefore, the development of guidelines for vascular access management seems logical. A team of multidisciplinary vascular access experts created a set of algorithms covering the whole spectrum from pre-operative vessel assessment, peri-operative access management and post-operative follow up and surveillance. Additionally, a range of various access complications with their diagnosis and treatment options were included in these algorithms. The new European guidelines for vascular access augment the knowledge of vascular access problems and their management. Additionally, the use of algorithms facilitates the decision-making when treating complications by all physicians dedicated to this field of healthcare.

AB  - Context: Although symptom clusters have been studied in the context of cancer, few data exist in chronic and end-stage kidney disease (CKD/ESKD) patients.Objectives: The objectives of this study were to 1) characterize and compare symptom cluster phenotypes in patients with advanced CKD, ESKD, and cancer and 2) explore predictors of symptom clusters.Methods: We conducted secondary data analysis of three prospective studies in which pain, depression, and fatigue were assessed in patients with Stage 4-5 CKD, ESKD, and gastrointestinal cancer. Tetrachoric correlations between these symptoms were quantified, and partitioning around medoids algorithm was used for symptom cluster analysis.Results: In the 82 CKD, 149 ESKD, and 606 cancer patients, no differences in the average fatigue (P = 0.17) or pain levels (P = 0.21) were observed. Over 80% of patients in each group had at least one symptom. Moderate or severe depressive symptoms were more common in patients with cancer (31% vs. 19% in ESKD vs. 9% in CKD; P < 0.001). Mild-moderate correlations were observed between the three symptoms in ESKD and cancer patients. Three distinct clusters were observed in each group. In ESKD, the HIGH cluster (with high probability of pain, depression, and fatigue) had higher body mass index (P < 0.001) and antidepressant use (P = 0.01). In cancer patients, the HIGH cluster patients were more likely to be female (P = 0.04), use antidepressants (P = 0.04), and have lower serum albumin (P < 0.001) and hemoglobin (P = 0.03) compared to the other two clusters.Conclusion: Although the burden of fatigue, pain, and depressive symptoms for CKD and ESKD patients is similar to patients with gastrointestinal cancer, symptom cluster phenotypes differed between the groups as did the predictors of symptom clusters.

AB  - The substantial reduction in ischemic events provided by the dual antiplatelet regimen with aspirin and clopidogrel is well documented in patients with acute coronary syndrome and patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Recently the variable response to the antiplatelet agents has received considerable attention after several "boxed warnings" on clopidogrel. This led to intense controversy on pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacogenomic issues of antiplatelet drugs, especially clopidogrel. Research use of platelet function testing has been successfully validated in identifying new antiplatelet drugs like prasugrel and ticagrelor. These platelet function assays are no longer regarded just as a laboratory phenomenon but rather as tools that have been shown to predict mortality in several clinical trials. It is believed that suboptimal response to an antiplatelet regimen (pharmacodynamic effect) may be associated with cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral arterial events. There has been intense controversy about this variable response of antiplatelet drugs and the role of platelet function testing to guide antiplatelet therapy. While the importance of routine platelet function testing may be uncertain, it may be useful in high-risk patients such as those with diabetes mellitus, diffuse three vessels coronary artery disease, left main stenosis, diffuse atherosclerotic disease, and those with chronic renal failure undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. It could also be useful in patients with suspected pharmacodynamic interaction with other drugs to assure the adequacy of platelet inhibition. While we wait for definitive trials, a predictive prognostic algorithm is necessary to individualize antiplatelet therapy with P2Y12 inhibitors based on platelet function assays and genetic testing.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In the past years, several risk charts have been created to increase the accuracy of cardiovascular risk stratification. The most widely used and validated algorithms do not included target organ damage as risk prediction. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether preclinical renal damage is associated with cardiovascular diseases independently of individual risk profile assessed by risk charts. METHODS: The study population was that of Italy-Developing Education and awareness on MicroAlbuminuria in patients with hypertensive Disease, a large observational study conducted on hypertensive patients in Italy. The Framingham Risk Score (FRS), Systematic COronary Risk Estimation (SCORE) and Progetto Cuore Risk Score (Progetto Cuore RS) were computed in each eligible patient. Chronic kidney disease was defined by the presence of albuminuria or by a reduction of glomerular filtration rate. RESULTS: Study participants were categorized to have low, medium and high risk according to the tertiles of the three charts. Prevalence of total cardiovascular diseases progressively and significantly increased according to the degrees of risk assessed by the three charts, the highest prevalence being in participants with a high-risk profile (both high and medium vs. low risk <0.01 for FRS, SCORE and Progetto Cuore RS). The presence of chronic kidney disease was associated with total cardiovascular diseases, independently of FRS (odds ratio 1.64, 95% confidence interval 1.33-2.02, P < 0.001), SCORE (odds ratio 1.55, 95% confidence interval 1.21-1.98, P < 0.001) and Progetto Cuore RS (odds ratio 1.59, 95% confidence interval 1.22-2.07, P < 0.001). Moreover, inclusion of renal damage in the logistic model significantly increased the accuracy of the FRS (P < 0.05), SCORE (P < 0.01) and Progetto Cuore RS (P < 0.01) to identify patients with overt cardiovascular diseases. CONCLUSION: Identification of patients with preclinical renal damage should be encouraged in the hypertension cardiovascular risk stratification setting in order to achieve a more accurate individual risk computation. The presence of renal damage could improve cardiovascular risk prediction over the widely used risk stratification charts.

AB  - Key Points: Question: Are mental health disorders associated with health care utilization and costs among people with chronic diseases? Findings: In this population-based cohort study of 991 445 Canadian adults, including 156 296 with a mental health disorder, 3-year adjusted mean costs were $38 250 for those with a mental health disorder and $22 280 for those without a mental health disorder. Presence of a mental health disorder was associated with higher rates of hospitalization and emergency department visits, including when considering only visits associated with chronic disease and ambulatory care–sensitive conditions. Meaning: In this study, mental health disorders were associated with substantially higher resource utilization and health care costs in patients with chronic diseases. This population-based cohort study determines the association of mental health disorders with health care utilization and costs for Canadian adults with chronic disease. Importance: A population-based study using validated algorithms to estimate the costs of treating people with chronic disease with and without mental health disorders is needed. Objective: To determine the association of mental health disorders with health care costs among people with chronic diseases. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study in the Canadian province of Alberta collected data from April 1, 2012, to March 31, 2015, among 991 445 adults 18 years and older with a chronic disease (ie, asthma, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, diabetes, epilepsy, hypertension, chronic pulmonary disease, or chronic kidney disease). Data analysis was conducted from October 2017 to August 2018. Exposures: Mental health disorder (ie, depression, schizophrenia, alcohol use disorder, or drug use disorder). Main Outcomes and Measures: Resource use, mean total unadjusted and adjusted 3-year health care costs, and mean total unadjusted 3-year costs for hospitalization and emergency department visits for ambulatory care–sensitive conditions. Results: Among 991 445 participants, 156 296 (15.8%) had a mental health disorder. Those with no mental health disorder were older (mean [SD] age, 58.1 [17.6] years vs 55.4 [17.0] years; P <.001) and less likely to be women (50.4% [95% CI, 50.3%-50.5%] vs 57.7% [95% CI, 57.4%-58.0%]; P <.001) than those with mental health disorders. For those with a mental health disorder, mean total 3-year adjusted costs were $38 250 (95% CI, $36 476-$39 935), and for those without a mental health disorder, mean total 3-year adjusted costs were $22 280 (95% CI, $21 780-$22 760). Having a mental health disorder was associated with significantly higher resource use, including hospitalization and emergency department visit rates, length of stay, and hospitalization for ambulatory care–sensitive conditions. Higher resource use by patients with mental health disorders was not associated with health care presentations owing to chronic diseases compared with patients without a mental health disorder (chronic disease hospitalization rate per 1000 patient days, 0.11 [95% CI, 0.11-0.12] vs 0.06 [95% CI, 0.06-0.06]; P <.001; overall hospitalization rate per 1000 patient days, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.87-0.88] vs 0.43 [95% CI, 0.43-0.43]; P <.001). Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that mental health disorders are associated with substantially higher resource utilization and health care costs among patients with chronic diseases. These findings have clinical and health policy implications.

AB  - Background: The proper strategy to screen for early chronic kidney disease is debatable, but protein-creatinine ratio from a random urine sample (UPC) commonly is used. The purpose is to determine whether dipstick data effectively identify patients with increased UPC ratios. Because urine concentration affects proteinuria interpretation, we hypothesized that dipstick protein (DSP) and specific gravity (SG) are sufficient for screening.Methods: A hospital laboratory database was searched for urine samples simultaneously assayed for UPC ratio, DSP, and SG (n = 2,098). A random 70% of the cohort was used to generate a development model, which was validated in the remaining 30%. Samples were stratified according to DSP and SG values. A DSP versus SG matrix was created, and each sample was allocated to a discrete DSP-SG category. Proportions of samples with overt (UPC ratio > or = 500 mg/g) and nephrotic-range proteinuria (UPC ratio > or = 3,000 mg/g) were calculated for all 40 cells.Results: Optimum correlations between DSP-SG cells and UPC ratios were determined for the development model, yielding 97.0% negative predictive value (NPV) for a UPC ratio of 500 mg/g or less and 97.5% positive predictive value (PPV) for a UPC ratio of 500 mg/g or greater. NPV for a UPC ratio of 3,000 mg/g or less was 99.7%. Application of the model to the validation sample showed a 96.5% NPV for a UPC ratio of 500 mg/g or less, 99.4% PPV for a UPC ratio of 500 mg/g or greater, and 99.0% NPV for a UPC ratio of 3,000 mg/g or less.Conclusion: DSP and SG values effectively identify patients requiring proteinuria quantification by means of UPC ratio. A Web-based tool was developed that allows DSP and SG value entry and provides a recommendation regarding the need for proteinuria quantification.

AB  - Background: Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is the clinical standard for assessing kidney function and staging chronic kidney disease. Automated reporting of eGFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation was first implemented within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in 2007 with staggered adoption across laboratories. When automated eGFR are not used or unavailable, values are retrospectively calculated using clinical and demographic data that are currently available in the electronic health record (EHR). Due to the dynamic nature of EHRs, current data may not always match past data. Whether and to what extent the practice of re-calculating eGFR on retrospective data differs from using the automated values is unknown.Methods: We assessed clinical data for patients enrolled in VA who had their first automated eGFR lab in 2013.We extracted the eGFR value, the corresponding serum creatinine value, and patient race, gender, and date of birth from the EHR. The MDRD equation was applied to retrospectively calculate eGFR. Stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) was defined using both eGFR values. We used Bland-Altman plots and percent agreement to assess the difference between the automated and calculated values. We developed an algorithm to select the most parsimonious parameter set to explain the difference in values and used chart review on a small subsample of patients to determine if one approach more accurately describes the patient at the time of eGFR measurement.Results: We evaluated eGFR data pairs from 266,084 patients. Approximately 33.0% (n = 86,747) of eGFR values differed between automated and retrospectively calculated methods. The majority of discordant pairs were classified as the same CKD stage (n = 74,542, 85.93%). The Bland-Altman plot showed differences in the data pairs were centered near zero (mean difference: 0.8 mL/min/1.73m2) with 95% limits of agreement between - 6.4 and 8.0. A change in recorded age explained 95.6% (n = 78,903) of discordant values and 85.02% (n = 9371) of the discordant stages.Conclusions: Values of retrospectively calculated eGFR can differ from automated values, but do not always result in a significant classification change. In very large datasets these small differences could become significant.

AB  - The incidence and prevalence of end-stage renal disease continues to grow, even as treatments improve. The vascular steal phenomenon is an infrequent but often debilitating complication of dialysis access placement, and management can be difficult. A specific technique called distal revascularization-interval ligation, or the DRIL procedure, has been used with success in managing this problem. Anatomically, the site of the steal is bypassed, and the native vessel just distal to the steal site is ligated, making duplex sonography evaluation complex. An examination algorithm is presented, with illustrative examples, to assist the sonographer in evaluating dialysis access patients when they have had the DRIL procedure. The algorithm is based on breaking the study into more easily managed components: (1) duplex sonographic evaluation of arterial inflow and runoff as well as venous outflow, (2) duplex sonographic evaluation of the bypass graft, (3) duplex sonographic evaluation of the fistula/shunt, and (4) physiologic testing of flows to the hand and digits. Based on the knowledge of the pathophysiology of steal and the configuration of the DRIL reconstruction, a complete and accurate evaluation can be performed with confidence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Starting hemodialysis therapy with an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is associated with improved patient survival. Clinical audit showed that less than 50% of our patients started hemodialysis therapy with an AVF. STUDY DESIGN: Quality improvement report, prospective before and after study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Tertiary referral hospital with 184 patients starting hemodialysis therapy in 2005 and 2006. QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PLAN: Situational analysis showed poor overall coordination of surgical waiting lists. Multifaceted intervention included vascular access nurse coordinator and an algorithm to prioritize surgery. OUTCOMES: Vascular access used at first hemodialysis treatment in patients with pre-end-stage renal disease in the 12 months before and after the intervention. MEASUREMENTS: Proportions of patients starting hemodialysis therapy with an AVF. RESULTS: Overall, 65% of patients started hemodialysis therapy with an AVF; 2%, with an arteriovenous graft; and 33%, with a catheter. The proportion of patients starting hemodialysis therapy with an AVF increased from 56% preimplementation to 75% postimplementation (P = 0.007). After adjustment for age, sex, late referral, cause of renal failure, and presentation type, patients starting dialysis therapy in the implementation phase were twice as likely to start treatment with an AVF (odds ratio, 2.85; P = 0.008). The total number of catheter-days in the implementation phase was half that of the preimplementation phase (2,833 v 4,685 days). LIMITATIONS: Nonrandomized study. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a multifaceted intervention including a vascular access nurse and an algorithm to prioritize surgery significantly increased the proportion of patients starting dialysis therapy with an AVF by improving the overall coordination of the surgical waiting list.

AB  - Background: HIV-positive persons bear an excess burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD); however, conventional methods to assess kidney health are insensitive and non-specific for detecting early kidney injury. Urinary biomarkers can detect early kidney injury, and may help mitigate the risk of overt CKD.Methods: Cross-sectional study of HIV-positive persons in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study and the Women's Interagency HIV Study. We measured levels of 14 biomarkers, capturing multiple dimensions of kidney injury. We then evaluated associations of known CKD risk factors with urine biomarkers using separate multivariable adjusted models for each biomarker.Results: Of the 198 participants, one third were on HAART and virally suppressed. The vast majority (95%) had preserved kidney function as assessed by serum creatinine, with a median eGFR of 103 ml/min/1.73 m2 (interquartile range (IQR): 88, 116). In our multivariable analyses, the associations of each CKD risk factor with urinary biomarker levels varied in magnitude. For example, HIV viral load was predominantly associated with elevations in interleukin(IL)-18, and albuminuria, while higher CD4 levels were associated with lower monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and β2-microglobulin. In contrast, older age was significantly associated with elevations in α1-microglobulin, kidney injury marker-1, clusterin, MCP-1, and chitinase-3-like protein-1 levels, as well as lower epidermal growth factor, and uromodulin levels.Conclusions: Among HIV-positive persons, CKD risk factors are associated with unique and heterogeneous patterns of changes in urine biomarkers levels. Additional work is needed to develop parsimonious algorithms that integrate multiple biomarkers and clinical data to discern the risk of overt CKD and its progression.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health problem that is associated with excess morbidity, mortality, and health resource utilization. The progression of CKD is defined by a decrease in glomerular filtration rate and leads to a variety of metabolic abnormalities including acidosis, hypertension, anemia, and mineral bone disorder. Lower glomerular filtration rate also bears a strong relationship with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, end-stage renal disease, and death. Patterns of CKD progression include linear and nonlinear trajectories, but kidney function can remain stable for years in some individuals. Addressing modifiable risk factors for the progression of CKD is needed to attenuate its associated morbidity and mortality. Developing effective risk prediction models for CKD progression is critical to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from interventions and more intensive monitoring. Accurate risk-prediction algorithms permit systems to best align health care resources with risk to maximize their effects and efficiency while guiding overall decision making.

AB  - Objectives To use the Medicare Files of Service Use ( MFSU) to evaluate patterns in the incidence of aging-related diseases in the U.S. elderly population. Design Age-specific incidence rates of 19 aging-related diseases were evaluated using the National Long Term Care Survey ( NLTCS) and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results ( SEER) Registry data, both linked to MFSU ( NLTCS-M and SEER-M, respectively), using an algorithm developed for individual date at onset evaluation. Setting A random sample from the entire U.S. elderly population (Medicare beneficiaries) was used in NLTCS, and the SEER Registry data covers 26% of the U.S. population. Participants Thirty-four thousand seventy-seven individuals from NLTCS-M and 2,154,598 from SEER-M. Measurements Individual medical histories were reconstructed using information on diagnoses coded in MFSU, dates of medical services and procedures, and Medicare enrollment and disenrollment. Results The majority of diseases (e.g., prostate cancer, asthma, and diabetes mellitus) had a monotonic decline (or decline after a short period of increase) in incidence with age. A monotonic increase in incidence with age with a subsequent leveling off and decline was observed for myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, ulcer, and Alzheimer's disease. An inverted U-shaped age pattern was detected for lung and colon carcinomas, Parkinson's disease, and renal failure. The results obtained from the NLTCS-M and SEER-M were in agreement (excluding an excess for circulatory diseases in the NLTCS-M). A sensitivity analysis proved the stability of the incidence rates evaluated. Conclusion The developed computational approaches applied to the nationally representative Medicare-based data sets allow reconstruction of age patterns of disease incidence in the U.S. elderly population at the national level with unprecedented statistical accuracy and stability with respect to systematic biases.

AB  - Trials of anemia correction in chronic kidney disease have found either no benefit or detrimental outcomes of higher targets. We did a secondary analysis of patients with chronic kidney disease enrolled in the Correction of Hemoglobin in the Outcomes in Renal Insufficiency trial to measure the potential for competing benefit and harm from achieved hemoglobin and epoetin dose trials. In the 4 month analysis, significantly more patients in the high-hemoglobin compared to the low-hemoglobin arm were unable to achieve target hemoglobin and required high-dose epoetin-alpha. In unadjusted analyses, the inability to achieve a target hemoglobin and high-dose epoetin-alpha were each significantly associated with increased risk of a primary endpoint (death, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure or stroke). In adjusted models, high-dose epoetin-alpha was associated with a significant increased hazard of a primary endpoint but the risk associated with randomization to the high hemoglobin arm did not suggest a possible mediating effect of higher target via dose. Similar results were seen in the 9 month analysis. Our study demonstrates that patients achieving their target had better outcomes than those who did not; and among subjects who achieved their randomized target, no increased risk associated with the higher hemoglobin goal was detected. Prospective studies are needed to confirm this relationship and determine safe dosing algorithms for patients unable to achieve target hemoglobin.

AB  - Findings from randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy of therapy with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to normalize hemoglobin levels in patients with chronic kidney disease or kidney failure have raised questions regarding the safety of this class of drugs. However, no trial to date has specifically assessed the safety of ESA-dosing algorithms used to achieve the lower hemoglobin targets typically using in clinical practice. Although a wealth of nonexperimental data is available for dialysis patients, analyses based on these data are more susceptible to confounding bias than randomized controlled trials. Conducting valid pharmacoepidemiologic studies of drug effects in hemodialysis patients is complicated by the extent of their comorbidities, frequent hospitalizations, various concomitant medications, and an exceedingly high mortality rate. The need for greater ESA doses for the treatment of anemia in sicker patients potentially and plausibly generates confounding by indication, the control of which is complicated by the presence of time-dependent confounding. Here, we describe sources of bias in nonexperimental studies of ESA therapy in hemodialysis patients and critically appraise analytical methods that may help minimize bias in such studies.

AB  - The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) will in the future remain high, partly due to an increase in comorbidities and other AKI favoring factors such as the rise in high-risk diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. AKI has emerged as a major public health concern with high human and financial costs. It has recently been demonstrated that patients surviving an AKI episode show increased all-cause mortality, chronic kidney disease (CKD), ESRD, cardiovascular events, and reduced quality of life. Although it is important to acknowledge that, after an AKI episode, the risk of dying by far exceeds the risk of developing incident or progressive CKD and/or entering a maintenance renal replacement therapy (RRT) program, currently only a minority of patients are referred for renal follow-up, even after AKI-requiring RRT. On the other hand, renal follow-up for all AKI survivors might not be necessary and would represent an overwhelming work load for the health care system. There are at present no clear guidelines on which patients should be referred and on the elements of post AKI care that may improve non-renal and renal outcomes. In this review, we discuss several points of concern in post-AKI management and propose an algorithm on post-AKI care, mainly based on the renal recovery pattern at discharge from the hospital. Potential opportunities to improve care include appropriate risk stratification, close monitoring of kidney function, management of CKD complications, blood pressure control, medication reconciliation, and education of patients and non-nephrologists on AKI and its downstream complications.

AB  - To limit patients who may be at risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis from exposure to gadolinium-based magnetic resonance contrast agents, new policies and procedures have been implemented at Yale-New Haven Hospital. These changes include screening patients for low estimated glomerular filtration rates and risk factors for chronic kidney disease, giving increased attention to the types and doses of contrast agent administered, agreement on alternative imaging algorithms, and education at all levels of the medical community. The rationale for these changes is discussed.

AB  - The high prevalence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in many Asian countries is attributed to diabetes and hypertension. Health care expenditure in relation to per capita income and government share of this expenditure vary among Asian countries and are affected by large populations and the poverty factor. The impact of ESRD on nutritional management in Asia reveals the need for clinicians to balance the requirements for higher standards of dietetic practice as they implement optimal care algorithms with the goal of improving outcomes, against the backdrop of staffing limitations, limited expertise in renal nutrition practice, and cultural diversity among Asian people. This paper discusses current aspects of dietetic practice and the likelihood that a change in practice is required if dietitians are to play an active role in preventing or slowing down ESRD.

AB  - Context: Blood type and crossmatch incompatibility will exclude at least one third of patients in need from receiving a live donor kidney transplant. Kidney paired donation (KPD) offers incompatible donor/recipient pairs the opportunity to match for compatible transplants. Despite its increasing popularity, very few transplants have resulted from KPD.Objective: To determine the potential impact of improved matching schemes on the number and quality of transplants achievable with KPD.Design, Setting, and Population: We developed a model that simulates pools of incompatible donor/recipient pairs. We designed a mathematically verifiable optimized matching algorithm and compared it with the scheme currently used in some centers and regions. Simulated patients from the general community with characteristics drawn from distributions describing end-stage renal disease patients eligible for renal transplantation and their willing and eligible live donors.Main Outcome Measures: Number of kidneys matched, HLA mismatch of matched kidneys, and number of grafts surviving 5 years after transplantation.Results: A national optimized matching algorithm would result in more transplants (47.7% vs 42.0%, P<.001), better HLA concordance (3.0 vs 4.5 mismatched antigens; P<.001), more grafts surviving at 5 years (34.9% vs 28.7%; P<.001), and a reduction in the number of pairs required to travel (2.9% vs 18.4%; P<.001) when compared with an extension of the currently used first-accept scheme to a national level. Furthermore, highly sensitized patients would benefit 6-fold from a national optimized scheme (2.3% vs 14.1% successfully matched; P<.001). Even if only 7% of patients awaiting kidney transplantation participated in an optimized national KPD program, the health care system could save as much as $750 million.Conclusions: The combination of a national KPD program and a mathematically optimized matching algorithm yields more matches with lower HLA disparity. Optimized matching affords patients the flexibility of customizing their matching priorities and the security of knowing that the greatest number of high-quality matches will be found and distributed equitably.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) require dialysis to maintain survival. The optimal timing of dialysis initiation in terms of cost-effectiveness has not been established. METHODS: . We developed a simulation model of individuals progressing towards ESRD and requiring dialysis. It can be used to analyze dialysis strategies and scenarios. It was embedded in an optimization frame worked to derive improved strategies. RESULTS: . Actual (historical) and simulated survival curves and hospitalization rates were virtually indistinguishable. The model overestimated transplantation costs (10%) but it was related to confounding by Medicare coverage. To assess the model's robustness, we examined several dialysis strategies while input parameters were perturbed. Under all 38 scenarios, relative rankings remained unchanged. An improved policy for a hypothetical patient was derived using an optimization algorithm. CONCLUSION: . The model produces reliable results and is robust. It enables the cost-effetiveness analysis of dialysis strategies.

AB  - Problems related to hemodialysis access are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease. Physicians of all specialties who are involved in the placement and maintenance of vascular access for hemodialysis must have a long-term strategy for sequential placement of autogenous fistulas, transpositions, and prosthetic grafts to preserve access sites and to avoid long-term use of tunneled dialysis catheters. The Fistula First and KDOQI initiatives have provided strategies and algorithms for access placement in patients with chronic kidney disease. Preservation of veins should begin before dialysis access is necessary to achieve the goal of creating a primary arteriovenous (AV) fistula or transposition suitable for cannulation when dialysis is initiated. Prosthetic and biologic grafts offer reasonable alternatives when autogenous access is not feasible. Newer graft materials and conduits are under evaluation to improve long-term outcomes. Use of tunneled dialysis catheters should be discouraged and they should be considered a last resort for long-term access. We present a strategy from the perspective of a vascular surgeon for the sequential placement of AV fistulas, venous transpositions, and AV grafts in these challenging patients. We also discuss specific concerns regarding hemodialysis access in difficult patient populations such as the elderly patient and the morbidly obese patient.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study end-of-life care of a representative sample of older people using qualitative interpretation of administrative claims by clinicians and to explore whether this method yields insights into patient care, including continuity, errors, and cause of death. DESIGN: Random, stratified sampling of decedents and all their Medicare-covered healthcare claims in the 3 years before death from a 5% sample of elderly fee-for-service beneficiaries, condensation of all claims into a chronological clinical summary, and abstraction by two independent clinicians using a standardized form. SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred Medicare fee-for-service older people without disability or end-stage renal disease entitlement who died in 1996 to 1999 and had at least 36 months of continuous Part A and Part B enrollment before death. MEASUREMENTS: Qualitative narrative of the patient's medical course; clinician assessment of care continuity and apparent medical errors; cause, trajectory, and place of death. RESULTS: The qualitative narratives developed by the independent abstracters were highly concordant. Clinicians felt that 75% of cases lacked continuity of care that could have improved the quality of life and the way the person died, and 13% of cases had a medical error identified by both abstracters. Abstracters disagreed about assignment of a single cause of death in 28% of cases, and abstracters and the computer algorithm disagreed in 43% of cases. CONCLUSION: Qualitative claims analysis illuminated many problems in the care of chronically ill older people at the end of life and suggested that traditional vital statistics assignation of a single cause of death may distort policy priorities. This novel approach to claims review is feasible and deserves further study.

AB  - The manner in which deceased donor kidneys are allocated has broad relevance to the care of patients with end-stage renal disease. An algorithm governing the allocation of deceased donor kidneys has been applied in the United States since 1987. Adjustments were made to facilitate the national sharing of highly matched kidneys, but the main components of the algorithm remained largely unchanged. In ensuing years, the number of patients on the waiting list has increased steadily while the supply of kidneys has remained constant. The waiting time for an organ now is measured in years, and the allocation of organs has become unpredictable. As of October 2002, several important changes have been made to the algorithm. These changes are designed to increase the relative number of minority patients who undergo transplantation and the use of extended-criteria donor kidneys. They also have practical implications for the management of patients on the waiting list. The rationale behind these changes is discussed in the context of the ethical underpinnings of kidney allocation.

AB  - To describe gene expression changes that characterize the development of diabetic nephropathy, we performed microarray and phenotype analysis on kidneys from db/db mice (a model of type 2 diabetes), streptozotocin-induced diabetic C57BL/6J mice (a model of type 1 diabetes), and nondiabetic controls. Statistical comparisons were implemented based on phenotypic outcome characteristics of the animals. We used weighted vote-based supervised analytical methods to find genes whose expression can classify samples based on the presence or absence of mesangial matrix expansion, the best indicator for the development of end-stage renal disease in humans. We identified hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-3beta isotype 4 and osteopontin as lead classifier genes in relation to the mesangial matrix expansion phenotype. We used the expression levels of these genes in the kidney to classify a separate group of animals for the absence or presence of diabetic glomerulopathy with a high degree of precision. Immunohistochemical analysis of murine and human diabetic kidney samples showed that both markers were expressed in podocytes in the glomeruli and followed regulation similar to that observed in the microarray. The application of phenotype-based statistical modeling approaches has led to the identification of new markers for the development of diabetic kidney disease.

AB  - Objective: Control of hypertension in patients with diabetic nephropathy improves mortality and slows progression to end-stage renal disease. However, blood pressure is difficult to treat; multiple drug combination therapy is required and treatment algorithms to establish this are lacking. We used a stepped-care algorithm, centered on maximum doses of an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker, to treat hypertension according to American Diabetes Association recommended blood pressure target goals (<130/80 mmHg) in patients with diabetic nephropathy.Research Design and Methods: We treated 49 consecutive patients with diabetes (13 with type 1 and 36 with type 2), diabetic nephropathy, and proteinuria > or =500 mg/24 h with a stepped-care blood pressure treatment algorithm. The level of blood pressure control achieved at most recent follow-up was assessed.Results: Patients were followed for a median of 18 months (range 9-48). Mean blood pressure achieved was 140/75 +/- 23/14 mmHg in patients with type 1 diabetes and 146/76 +/- 22/14 mmHg in patients with type 2 diabetes. Target blood pressure was reached in 16 (33%) patients, 6 of 13 patients with type 1 diabetes and 10 of 36 patients with type 2 diabetes, whereas systolic blood pressure remained above the target level in the remaining patients. There was no difference in baseline blood pressure, proteinuria, or serum creatinine level between patients who were treated to target and those who were not.Conclusions: Levels of blood pressure control similar to those achieved in clinical trials in diabetic nephropathy were obtained with a stepped-care algorithm. However, in most patients, systolic blood pressure was difficult to control to target despite the use of multiple drug combination therapy.

AB  - Diabetes is the single largest cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in adults in the U.S. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) has been recognized for some time as an important cause of ESRD, but non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) has been assumed, until recently, to rarely cause ESRD. The objective of this study is to determine the incidence of treatment of diabetic ESRD by diabetic type for three ethnic/racial groups: non-Hispanic whites, African-Americans, and Mexican-Americans. A population-based incidence cohort was assembled from all dialysis centers in Bexar (San Antonio) and Dallas counties in Texas. All patients with diabetic ESRD beginning dialysis between 1 December 1987 (Bexar) or 1 December 1988 (Dallas) and 31 July 1991 were identified. All non-hispanic whites and African-Americans and a 1/2 random sample of Mexican-Americans were approached for enrollment. Individuals were confirmed to have diabetes using the World Health Organization criteria. Diabetes typing was done using a computerized historical algorithm. Age-specific and age-adjusted incidence rates were obtained by diabetic type and ethnic/racial group. NIDDM causes the majority of diabetic ESRD: 59.5% for non-Hispanic whites, 92.8% for Mexican-Americans, and 84.3% for African-Americans. Mexican-Americans and African-Americans, respectively, have 6.1 and 6.5 times higher incidence of treatment for diabetic ESRD than non-Hispanic whites. NIDDM results in more ESRD than does IDDM. Minorities (African-Americans and Mexican-Americans) are at increased risk, and programs aimed at prevention of NIDDM-related ESRD must focus on them.

AB  - In this in-depth review, we examine the worldwide epidemiology of SLE and summarize current knowledge on the influence of race/ethnicity on clinical manifestations, disease activity, damage accumulation and outcome in SLE. Susceptibility to SLE has a strong genetic component, and trans-ancestral genetic studies have revealed a substantial commonality of shared genetic risk variants across different genetic ancestries that predispose to the development of SLE. The highest increased risk of developing SLE is observed in black individuals (incidence 5- to 9-fold increased, prevalence 2- to 3-fold increased), with an increased risk also observed in South Asians, East Asians and other non-white groups, compared with white individuals. Black, East Asian, South Asian and Hispanic individuals with SLE tend to develop more severe disease with a greater number of manifestations and accumulate damage from lupus more rapidly. Increased genetic risk burden in these populations, associated with increased autoantibody reactivity in non-white individuals with SLE, may explain the more severe lupus phenotype. Even after taking into account socio-economic factors, race/ethnicity remains a key determinant of poor outcome, such as end-stage renal failure and mortality, in SLE. Community measures to expedite diagnosis through increased awareness in at-risk racial/ethnic populations and ethnically personalized treatment algorithms may help in future to improve long-term outcomes in SLE.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: We reviewed the strategies associated with hypoglycemia risk reduction among critically ill non-pregnant adult patients.Recent Findings: Hypoglycemia in the ICU has been associated with increased mortality in a number of studies. Insulin dosing and glucose monitoring rules, response to impending hypoglycemia, use of computerization, and attention to modifiable factors extrinsic to insulin algorithms may affect the risk for hypoglycemia. Recurring use of intravenous (IV) bolus doses of insulin in insulin-resistant cases may reduce reliance upon higher IV infusion rates. In order to reduce the risk for hypoglycemia in the ICU, caregivers should define responses to interruption of continuous carbohydrate exposure, incorporate transitioning strategies upon initiation and interruption of IV insulin, define modifications of antihyperglycemic therapy in the presence of worsening renal function or chronic kidney disease, and anticipate the effects traceable to other medications and substances. Institutional and system-wide quality improvement efforts should assign priority to hypoglycemia prevention.

AB  - Background: The optimal treatment algorithm for iron therapy and the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) in anemic hemodialysis (HD) patients has not been established. Hemoglobin (Hb) target levels can be achieved through more frequent intravenous (IV) iron use with lower ESA dose, or with less iron dosing but higher ESA. ESA therapy to correct anemia may result in severe arterial and venous thrombotic complications and the evidence base evaluating hard clinical outcomes related to the use of IV iron is sparse.Methods: A total of 1247 maintenance HD patients from 12 dialysis centers in Portugal (n = 730) and Poland (n = 517) were considered. We assessed achievement of KDIGO renal anemia targets with focus on treatment strategies, which typically differ between countries. In Poland the use and dose of IV iron was 35-72% higher than that in Portugal (p <  0.001) during three consecutive months; use and dose of ESA was 61% higher in Portugal (5034 vs 3133 IU (adjusted)/week, p <  0.001).Results: Mean Hb concentration was similar (11.0 vs 11.0 g/dL) in patients treated in both countries and the proportion of patients within KDIGO anemia target was 69.5% in Poland vs 65.8% in Portugal (NS). Ferritin and TSAT levels and the proportion of patients with TSAT > 20 and > 50% were both significantly higher in patients in Poland (88.8 and 14.6%) than in Portugal (76.3 and 5.7% respectively, p <  0.001). Significantly more patients in Poland had a ferritin concentration > 800 μg/L (35.6%) compared to Portugal (15.8%, p <  0.001). The ESA resistance index (ERI) was significantly higher in patients treated in Portugal (p <  0.001). Correlation analyses showed confounding by treatment indication in unadjusted models. Multiple and logistic regression analyses showed that with ferritin within KDIGO recommended range of 200-800 μg/L the odds for Hb within guidelines increased significantly. Annual gross mortality was 16% in Poland and 13% in Portugal (NS); there were no differences in cause-specific mortality.Conclusions: Administration of high doses of IV iron in routine clinical HD practice may not be associated with considerable harm. However, large randomized controlled trials are needed to provide absolute evidence of iron safety.

AB  - Background/aims: Use of electronic health records and information technology to deliver more efficient clinical trials is attracting the attention of research funders and researchers. We report on methodological issues and data quality for a comparison of 'automated' and manual (or 'in-practice') methods for recruitment and randomisation in a large randomised controlled trial, with individual patient allocation in primary care.Methods: We conducted a three-arm randomised controlled trial in primary care to evaluate interventions to improve the uptake of invited NHS health checks for cardiovascular risk assessment. Eligible participants were identified using a borough-wide health check management information system. An in-practice recruitment and randomisation method used at 12 general practices required the research team to complete monthly visits to each general practice. For the fully automated method, employed for six general practices, randomisation of eligible participants was performed automatically and remotely using a bespoke algorithm embedded in the health check management information system.Results: There were 8588 and 4093 participants recruited for the manual and automated methods, respectively. The in-practice method was ready for implementation 3 months sooner than the automated method and the in-practice method allowed for full control and documentation of the randomisation procedure. However the in-practice approach was labour intensive and the requirement for participant records to be stored locally resulted in the loss of data for 10 practice months. No records for participants allocated using the automated method were lost. A fixed-effects meta-analysis showed that effect estimates for the primary outcome were consistent for the two allocation methods.Conclusions: This trial demonstrated the feasibility of automated recruitment and randomisation methods into a randomised controlled trial performed in primary care. Future research should explore the application of these techniques in other clinical contexts and health care settings.Trial Registration: Current Controlled Trials, ID: ISRCTN42856343 .

AB  - Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) have become ubiquitous in the current management of chronic inpatient and out-patient conditions. Many hospitals have developed practice patterns that allow placement of PICC lines by teams of nurses at the bedside. This practice has led to a proliferation of these central venous access devices, and their use has expanded. One of the con-sequences of a nurse-based placement team is the decrease in physician involvement in decisions regarding the placement of PICC lines. In some settings, PICC placement can become so routine that the type of access needed or the other clinical conditions affecting an individual patient may be overlooked. One example of this problem is the situation in which a patient with chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease needs venous access for a nondialysis reason, such as antibiotics, cancer therapy, or total parenteral nutrition. The author discusses ramifications of this problem as well as ways to reduce the chances of mistakes.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: There is increased interest in developing surrogate endpoints for clinical trials of chronic kidney disease progression, as the established clinically meaningful endpoint end-stage renal disease requires large and lengthy trials to assess drug efficacy. We describe recent developments in the search for novel surrogate endpoints.Recent Findings: Declines in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30% or 40% and albuminuria have been proposed as surrogates for end-stage renal disease. However, changes in eGFR or albuminuria may not be valid under all circumstances as drugs always have effects on multiple renal risk markers. Changes in each of these other 'off-target' risk markers can alter renal risk (either beneficially or adversely), and can thereby confound the relationship between surrogates that are based on single risk markers and renal outcome. Risk algorithms that integrate the short-term drug effects on multiple risk markers to predict drug effects on hard renal outcomes may therefore be more accurate. The validity of these risk algorithms is currently investigated.Summary: Given that drugs affect multiple renal risk markers, risk scores that integrate these effects are a promising alternative to using eGFR decline or albuminuria. Proper validation is required before these risk scores can be implemented.

AB  - Compared with the general population, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients continue to have a higher than expected morbidity and mortality. Hypoalbuminemia, anemia, hypertension, and inadequate dialysis are all thought to contribute to the high morbidity and mortality among ESRD patients. Anemia algorithms should help to standardize the approach to anemia and the use of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO), but clinicians still must review each patient individually, searching for and treating the multitude of interrelated factors that affect rHuEPO responsiveness. Hypoalbuminemia is a very strong predictor of increased morbidity and mortality in dialysis and nondialysis patients. The causes of hypoalbuminemia are multifactorial, and diagnosis of the cause of hypoalbuminemia is usually elusive. The basis of the poorer survival in US dialysis patients remains controversial, but inadequate dialysis has been implicated. To assure adequate dialysis, the dialysis prescription must be individualized for each patient, and delivered dialysis must be routinely monitored. Hypertension is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, which is also an important determinant of survival in ESRD patients. Hypertension should be treated in ESRD patients in conjunction with other interventions that are known to reverse left ventricular hypertrophy. Special efforts must be made in the medical management of hypoalbuminemia, anemia, hypertension, and dialysis treatment adequacy to improve survival in patients with ESRD.

AB  - Background: There are limited data to predict which patients with lower gastrointestinal bleeding are at risk for adverse outcomes. We aimed to develop a clinical tool based on admission variables to predict 30-day mortality in lower gastrointestinal bleeding.Methods: We used a validated machine learning algorithm to identify adult patients hospitalized with lower gastrointestinal bleeding at an academic medical center between 2008 and 2015. The cohort was split randomly into derivation and validation cohorts. In the derivation cohort, we used multiple logistic regression on all candidate admission variables to create a prediction model for 30-day mortality, using area under the receiving operator characteristic curve and misclassification rate to estimate prediction accuracy. Regression coefficients were used to derive an integer score, and mortality risk associated with point totals was assessed.Results: In the derivation cohort (n = 4044), 8 variables were most associated with 30-day mortality: age, dementia, metastatic cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic pulmonary disease, anticoagulant use, admission hematocrit, and albumin. The model yielded a misclassification rate of 0.06 and area under the curve of 0.81. The integer score ranged from -10 to 26 in the derivation cohort, with a misclassification rate of 0.11 and area under the curve of 0.74. In the validation cohort (n = 2060), the score had an area under the curve of 0.72 with a misclassification rate of 0.12. After dividing the score into 4 quartiles of risk, 30-day mortality in the derivation and validation sets was 3.6% and 4.4% in quartile 1, 4.9% and 7.3% in quartile 2, 9.9% and 9.1% in quartile 3, and 24% and 26% in quartile 4, respectively.Conclusions: A clinical tool can be used to predict 30-day mortality in patients hospitalized with lower gastrointestinal bleeding.

AB  - Background.: The erythropoietic-stimulating hormone, darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp; DPO; Amgen, Thousand Oaks, California) is a long-acting agent growing in popularity as the preferred anemia management agent for patients with chronic kidney disease. Use of this drug in existing patients treated with rHu-EPO (epoetin alfa; EPO) requires conversion dosing and the potential for serious alterations in previously stable and satisfactory hemoglobin levels. This study analyzed the dosing conversion recommended by Amgen to determine if the regimen resulted in stable hemoglobin values during the conversion.Methods. Twenty-nine stable patients on hemodialysis were selected for conversion from EPO to DPO. The dose of DPO was taken from the conversion table recommended by Amgen and based upon the patient's weekly EPO dose. The mean conversion dose was 40 mcg weekly. The patients were monitored monthly with hemoglobin, hematocrit routine chemistries, and iPTH levels according to unit policy. The dose of DPO was individually titrated to maintain the hemoglobin concentrations at target levels between 11.5 gm/dL and 13.3 gm/dL. At the end of six months, there was an analysis of the data to determine if the results warranted an adjustment in the DPO dose and if so, what the adjusted dosing factor should be.Results. Fifty-seven percent of the patients in the study group experienced a drop in hemoglobin levels below pre-DPO baseline levels (13.1+/-0.6 gm/dL) by the third month. The mean hemoglobin level dropped to 11.0_+1.2 gm/dL for the entire group, representing a mean 2+/-1.42 gm/dL reduction. Forty-five per- cent of patients had a 15% to 40% drop in hemoglobin (1.9 gm/dL-5.Ogm/dL). By the sixth month, patients were back to baseline hemoglobin (13.2_+2.0 gm/dL). The adjusted dose at this point averaged 107 mcg weekly. Statistical analysis suggested an adjustment of 48.4 mcg to each of the Amgen recommended dose conversion values.Conclusions. The current Amgen recommended DPO dose regimen for conversion from EPO resulted in a drop in hemoglobin from baseline levels in 57.2% of patients, suggesting that the current conversion table may underestimate the dose. Based upon a statistical analysis, an additional 48.4 (50) mcg to each recommended dose is needed to maintain baseline levels.

AB  - In this work we propose a comprehensive framework based on first-order logic (FOL) for mitigating (identifying and addressing) interactions between multiple clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) applied to a multi-morbid patient while also considering patient preferences related to the prescribed treatment. With this framework we respond to two fundamental challenges associated with clinical decision support: (1) concurrent application of multiple CPGs and (2) incorporation of patient preferences into the decision making process. We significantly expand our earlier research by (1) proposing a revised and improved mitigation-oriented representation of CPGs and secondary medical knowledge for addressing adverse interactions and incorporating patient preferences and (2) introducing a new mitigation algorithm. Specifically, actionable graphs representing CPGs allow for parallel and temporal activities (decisions and actions). Revision operators representing secondary medical knowledge support temporal interactions and complex revisions across multiple actionable graphs. The mitigation algorithm uses the actionable graphs, revision operators and available (and possibly incomplete) patient information represented in FOL. It relies on a depth-first search strategy to find a valid sequence of revisions and uses theorem proving and model finding techniques to identify applicable revision operators and to establish a management scenario for a given patient if one exists. The management scenario defines a safe (interaction-free) and preferred set of activities together with possible patient states. We illustrate the use of our framework with a clinical case study describing two patients who suffer from chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation, and who are managed according to CPGs for these diseases. While in this paper we are primarily concerned with the methodological aspects of mitigation, we also briefly discuss a high-level proof of concept implementation of the proposed framework in the form of a clinical decision support system (CDSS). The proposed mitigation CDSS "insulates" clinicians from the complexities of the FOL representations and provides semantically meaningful summaries of mitigation results. Ultimately we plan to implement the mitigation CDSS within our MET (Mobile Emergency Triage) decision support environment.

AB  - Background: Recommender systems have shown tremendous value for the prediction of personalized item recommendations for individuals in a variety of settings (e.g., marketing, e-commerce, etc.). User-based collaborative filtering is a popular recommender system, which leverages an individuals' prior satisfaction with items, as well as the satisfaction of individuals that are "similar". Recently, there have been applications of collaborative filtering based recommender systems for clinical risk prediction. In these applications, individuals represent patients, and items represent clinical data, which includes an outcome.Methods: Application of recommender systems to a problem of this type requires the recasting a supervised learning problem as unsupervised. The rationale is that patients with similar clinical features carry a similar disease risk. As the "Big Data" era progresses, it is likely that approaches of this type will be reached for as biomedical data continues to grow in both size and complexity (e.g., electronic health records). In the present study, we set out to understand and assess the performance of recommender systems in a controlled yet realistic setting. User-based collaborative filtering recommender systems are compared to logistic regression and random forests with different types of imputation and varying amounts of missingness on four different publicly available medical data sets: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2011-2012 on Obesity), Study to Understand Prognoses Preferences Outcomes and Risks of Treatment (SUPPORT), chronic kidney disease, and dermatology data. We also examined performance using simulated data with observations that are Missing At Random (MAR) or Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) under various degrees of missingness and levels of class imbalance in the response variable.Results: Our results demonstrate that user-based collaborative filtering is consistently inferior to logistic regression and random forests with different imputations on real and simulated data. The results warrant caution for the collaborative filtering for the purpose of clinical risk prediction when traditional classification is feasible and practical.Conclusions: CF may not be desirable in datasets where classification is an acceptable alternative. We describe some natural applications related to "Big Data" where CF would be preferred and conclude with some insights as to why caution may be warranted in this context.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Health information technology advancements have resulted in recent increased sophistication of the electronic health record, whereby patient demographic, physiological, and laboratory data can be extracted real-time and integrated into clinical decision support (CDS).Recent Findings: The implementation of health information technology advancements into CDS in the renal realm has been focused mainly on assessment of kidney function to guide medication dosing in the setting of reduced function or to reactively detect acute kidney injury (AKI) heralded by an abrupt increase in serum creatinine. More recent work has combined risk stratification algorithms to guide proactive diagnostic or therapeutic intervention to prevent AKI or reduce its severity.Summary: Early, real-time identification and notification to healthcare providers of patients at risk for, or with, acute or chronic kidney disease can drive simple interventions to reduce harm. Similarly, screening patients at risk for AKI with these platforms to alert research personnel will lead to improve study subject recruitment. However, sole reliance on electronic health record generated alerts without active healthcare team integration and assessment represents a major barrier to the realization of the potential of CDS to improve healthcare quality and outcomes.

AB  - Sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI) represent an important burden in intensive care unit clinical practices. The Journal published important contributions in sepsis for novel therapeutic approaches suggesting that combined molecular targets (e.g., dual inhibition of IL-1[beta] and IL-18, and coadministration of endothelial progenitor cells and stromal cell-derived factor-1[alpha] analog) could perform better. The clinical effectiveness of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D was reported in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Although its experimental properties appeared favorable in the pro- and antiinflammatory cytokine balance, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D failed to improve survival. Strategies for decreasing antimicrobial resistances are of particular importance. Effective (aerosolized antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia) and ineffective (procalcitonin algorithm for antibiotic deescalation) approaches were published. In 2014, several publications raised an important point shared by survivors from sepsis and/or AKI. The increased number of survivors over time brought out long-term sequelae, leading to a poor outcome after hospital discharge. Among them, cardiovascular events and chronic kidney disease may explain the significant increase in the risk of death, which can persist up to 10 years and significantly increases the use of health care. Postdischarge survival represents a new target for future research in sepsis and AKI to find how we can prevent and manage long-term sequelae. A milestone of the year was the Ebola outbreak. The Journal contributed to our better understanding of Ebola virus disease with a paper underlying the crucial role of a large implementation of pragmatic supportive care, including fluid infusion and correction of metabolic abnormalities, to save more lives.

AB  - Optimal detection and subsequent risk stratification of people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) requires simultaneous consideration of both kidney function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR]) and kidney damage (as indicated by albuminuria or proteinuria). Measurement of urinary albuminuria and proteinuria is hindered by a lack of standardisation regarding requesting, sample collection, reporting and interpretation of tests. A multidisciplinary working group was convened with the goal of developing and promoting recommendations that achieve consensus on these issues. The working group recommended that the preferred method for assessment of albuminuria in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients is urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) measurement in a first-void spot urine specimen. Where a first-void specimen is not possible or practical, a random spot urine specimen for UACR is acceptable. The working group recommended that adults with one or more risk factors for CKD should be assessed using UACR and estimated GFR every 1-2 years, depending on their risk-factor profile. Recommended testing algorithms and sex-specific cut-points for microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria are provided. The working group recommended that all pathology laboratories in Australia should implement the relevant recommendations as a vital component of an integrated national approach to detection of CKD.

AB  - Background: Growth-differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is an emerging humoral marker for risk stratification in cardiovascular disease. Cardiac-surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI), an important complication in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, is associated with poor prognosis. The present secondary analysis of an observational cohort study aimed to determine the role of GDF-15 in predicting CSA-AKI compared with the Cleveland-Clinic Acute Renal Failure (CC-ARF) score and a logistic regression model including variables associated with renal dysfunction.Methods: Preoperative plasma GDF-15 was determined in 1176 consecutive patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Patients with chronic kidney disease stage 5 were excluded. AKI was defined according to Kidney-Disease-Improving-Global-Outcomes (KDIGO) - creatinine criteria. The following variables were screened for association with development of postoperative AKI: age, gender, additive Euroscore, serum creatinine, duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, duration of surgery, type of surgery, total circulatory arrest, preoperative hemoglobin, preoperative oxygen-supplemented cerebral oxygen saturation, diabetes mellitus, hemofiltration during ECC, plasma GDF-15, high sensitivity troponin T (hsTNT), and N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP).Results: There were 258 patients (21.9 %) with AKI (AKI stage 1 (AKI-1), n = 175 (14.9 %); AKI-2, n = 6 (0.5 %); AKI-3, n = 77 (6.5 %)). The incidence of AKI-1 and AKI-3 increased significantly from the lowest to the highest tertiles of GDF-15. In logistic regression, preoperative GDF-15, additive Euroscore, age, plasma creatinine, diabetes mellitus, and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass were independently associated with AKI. Inclusion of GDF-15 in a logistic regression model comprising these variables significantly increased the area under the curve (AUC 0.738 without and 0.750 with GDF-15 included) and the net reclassification ability to predict AKI. Comparably, in receiver operating characteristic analysis the predictive capacity of the CC-ARF score (AUC 0.628) was improved by adding GDF-15 (AUC 0.684) but this score also had lower predictability than the logistic regression model. In random forest analyses the predictive capacity of GDF-15 was especially pronounced in patients with normal plasma creatinine.Conclusion: This suggests that preoperative plasma GDF-15 independently predicts postoperative AKI in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery and is particularly helpful for risk stratification in patients with normal creatinine.Trial Registration: NCT01166360 on July 20, 2010.

AB  - Objectives: To develop an electronic registry of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) treated in a nephrology practice in order to provide clinically meaningful measurement and population management to improve rates of blood pressure (BP) control.Methods: We combined data from multiple electronic sources: the billing system, structured fields in the electronic health record (EHR), and free text physician notes using natural language processing (NLP). We also used point-of-care worksheets to capture clinical rationale.Results: Nephrologist billing accurately identified patients with CKD. Using an algorithm that incorporated multiple BP readings increased the measured rate of control (130/80 mm Hg) from 37.1% to 42.3%. With the addition of NLP to capture BP readings from free text notes, the rate was 52.6%. Data from point-of-care worksheets indicated that in 52% of visits in which patients were identified as not having controlled BP, patients were actually at goal based on BP readings taken at home or on that day in the office.Conclusions: Building a method for clinically meaningful continuous performance measurement of BP control is possible, but will require data from multiple sources. Electronic measurement systems need to grow to be able to capture and process performance data from patients as well as in real-time from physicians.

AB  - Introduction: Marinobufagenin (MBG), an endogenous bufadienolide cardiac inotrope, is responsible for vasoconstriction and natriuresis [1,2]. Growing interest by its implication in volume expansion mediated hypertensive states such as essential hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic renal failure, primary aldosterism and preeclampsia (PE). Elevated endogenous MBG levels have been described early in preeclamptic patients [2-5].Aims: To develop a specific and sensitive analytical MBG assay with special attention for the limit of quantification (LOQ). An algorithm dealing with the MBG plasma levels might be established in the future, in order to help for prediction of the risk for preeclampsia in pregnant women.Method: A LC-MS/MS based assay designed to determine MBG in human plasma is being optimized. The obtained LOQ fully satisfies the need for quantification of MBG plasma levels in pregnancy (nmol/L range). After a validation process, a primary observational clinical study will allow us to confirm previous results observed in preeclampsia.Results and Discussion: We had the opportunity to authenticate the presence of MBG by LC-MS/MS in non-pregnant and in early-pregnant women. These pioneering preliminary results that are giving a promising perspective for early preeclampsia risk assessment in pregnant women will be confirmed with the clinical study.

AB  - Context: Because of high symptom burden, numerous comorbidities, and shortened life expectancy, dialysis patients are increasingly recognized as appropriate candidates for early and continuous supportive care.Objectives: The objectives of this study were to describe dialysis professionals' perceptions of the adequacy of supportive care in dialysis centers, barriers to providing it, suggestions for improving it, and familiarity with the existing evidence-based resources for supportive care of dialysis patients.Methods: The Coalition for Supportive Care of Kidney Patients conducted an online survey of dialysis professionals and administrators solicited through the 18 End-Stage Renal Disease Networks and the Renal Physicians Association.Results: Only 4.5% of 487 respondents believed their dialysis centers were presently providing high-quality supportive care. They identified bereavement support, spiritual support, and end-of-life care discussions as the top three unmet needs. They reported that lack of a predictive algorithm for prognosis was the top barrier, and "guidelines to help with decision-making in seriously ill patients" was the top priority to improve supportive care. A majority of respondents were unaware that an evidence-based validated prognostic model and a clinical practice guideline to help with decision-making were already available.Conclusion: Dialysis professionals report significant unmet supportive care needs and barriers in their centers with only a small minority rating themselves as competently providing supportive care. There is an urgent need for education of dialysis professionals about available supportive care resources to provide quality supportive care to dialysis patients.

AB  - Background: Large, population-based administrative healthcare databases can be used to identify patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) when serum creatinine laboratory results are unavailable. We examined the validity of algorithms that used combined hospital encounter and physician claims database codes for the detection of CKD in Ontario, Canada.Methods: We accrued 123,499 patients over the age of 65 from 2007 to 2010. All patients had a baseline serum creatinine value to estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). We developed an algorithm of physician claims and hospital encounter codes to search administrative databases for the presence of CKD. We determined the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of this algorithm to detect our primary threshold of CKD, an eGFR <45 mL/min per 1.73 m² (15.4% of patients). We also assessed serum creatinine and eGFR values in patients with and without CKD codes (algorithm positive and negative, respectively).Results: Our algorithm required evidence of at least one of eleven CKD codes and 7.7% of patients were algorithm positive. The sensitivity was 32.7% [95% confidence interval: (95% CI): 32.0 to 33.3%]. Sensitivity was lower in women compared to men (25.7 vs. 43.7%; p <0.001) and in the oldest age category (over 80 vs. 66 to 80; 28.4 vs. 37.6 %; p < 0.001). All specificities were over 94%. The positive and negative predictive values were 65.4% (95% CI: 64.4 to 66.3%) and 88.8% (95% CI: 88.6 to 89.0%), respectively. In algorithm positive patients, the median [interquartile range (IQR)] baseline serum creatinine value was 135 μmol/L (106 to 179 μmol/L) compared to 82 μmol/L (69 to 98 μmol/L) for algorithm negative patients. Corresponding eGFR values were 38 mL/min per 1.73 m² (26 to 51 mL/min per 1.73 m²) vs. 69 mL/min per 1.73 m² (56 to 82 mL/min per 1.73 m²), respectively.Conclusions: Patients with CKD as identified by our database algorithm had distinctly higher baseline serum creatinine values and lower eGFR values than those without such codes. However, because of limited sensitivity, the prevalence of CKD was underestimated.

AB  - The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Asia is growing at an alarming rate, posing significant clinical and economic risk to health care stakeholders. Commonly, Asian patients with T2D manifest a distinctive combination of characteristics that include earlier disease onset, distinct pathophysiology, syndrome of complications, and shorter life expectancy. Optimizing treatment outcomes for such patients requires a coordinated inclusive care plan and knowledgeable practitioners. Comprehensive management starts with medical nutrition therapy (MNT) in a broader lifestyle modification program. Implementing diabetes-specific MNT in Asia requires high-quality and transparent clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) that are regionally adapted for cultural, ethnic, and socioeconomic factors. Respected CPGs for nutrition and diabetes therapy are available from prestigious medical societies. For cost efficiency and effectiveness, health care authorities can select these CPGs for Asian implementation following abridgement and cultural adaptation that includes: defining nutrition therapy in meaningful ways, selecting lower cutoff values for healthy body mass indices and waist circumferences (WCs), identifying the dietary composition of MNT based on regional availability and preference, and expanding nutrition therapy for concomitant hypertension, dyslipidemia, overweight/obesity, and chronic kidney disease. An international task force of respected health care professionals has contributed to this process. To date, task force members have selected appropriate evidence-based CPGs and simplified them into an algorithm for diabetes-specific nutrition therapy. Following cultural adaptation, Asian and Asian-Indian versions of this algorithmic tool have emerged. The Asian version is presented in this report.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to test the functional and data collection capabilities of an online nutrition algorithm for patients with chronic kidney disease by comparing dietitian-selected nutrition diagnoses, etiologies, and interventions in hemodialysis (HD) patients with and without diabetes mellitus (DM).Design: Data were collected using an online nutrition screening tool and algorithm for HD patients based on the American Dietetic Association's Nutrition Care Process.Setting: Data were collected by dietitians in the United States, New Zealand, Australia, and Brazil.Patients: Patients undergoing HD under the care of a participating dietitian and who were deemed at nutrition risk at visit 1 were eligible to participate. Other inclusion criteria included age >19 years, able to speak and write English, and not receiving hospice care or the international equivalent. Data were available on 26 patients (50% males, 39% with DM). Mean baseline values were as follows: age, 56.3 years; body mass index, 28.2 kg/m(2); and serum albumin (bromocresol green), 36.8 g/L (3.68 g/dL). There were no statistically significant differences between DM and non-DM patients except in mean hemoglobin A1C.Main Outcome Measure: Differences in the frequency of selection of diagnoses, etiology, and intervention categories were compared.Results: The algorithm is under continuous development using input from participating dietitians, but its use was generally considered feasible. The initial data analysis showed that the algorithm is an effective method for collecting data on HD patients. In this small cohort, patients with and without DM had similar dietitian-selected nutrition diagnoses and etiologies, but had statistically significant differences in the dietitian-selected nutrition interventions that were selected most frequently. Health Care Team Referral was selected more often in DM patients (P < .003) and Recommendation of Specific Foods was selected more often in non-DM patients (P < .0170).Conclusion: This preliminary analysis shows that the algorithm can be used as both a clinical and a data collection tool. The test analysis, although small in sample size, showed interesting differences in the care of DM and non-DM HD patients.

AB  - Treating hyperglycemia is a critical aspect of managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but can be especially challenging in patients from vulnerable groups such as those with chronic kidney disease, African Americans, and older people. The dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors are relatively new oral antidiabetes drugs that have been incorporated into treatment algorithms over the past few years and have also been studied in these vulnerable patients. Clinical trials with DPP-4 inhibitors have now been reported for all these patient groups and have demonstrated significant improvements in measures of hyperglycemia, with a good safety profile. Based on the current evidence, it appears that the DPP-4 inhibitors are worthy of consideration not only for the most straightforward patients with T2DM, but also for these vulnerable patients.

AB  - Pharmacologic doses of glucocorticoids and chronic renal failure are challenging comorbidities and complications for safe and effective dosing of insulin for the management of hospitalized patients with diabetes. Glucocorticoids are used widely in hospitalized patients and will commonly provoke new-onset hyperglycemia in patients without a prior history of diabetes or will provoke severely uncontrolled hyperglycemia in patients with known diabetes. Insulin therapy is invariably necessary for the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia and must be tailored to the pharmacodynamics of the glucocorticoid being given. Renal failure causes a decrease in the clearance of insulin, especially exogenous injected insulin. Dosing algorithms for hospitalized patients should be adjusted for patients with renal failure in order to minimize hypoglycemia. Many patients with type 2 diabetes will need little or no therapy after the development of end-stage renal failure. Care must be taken to avoid the overtreatment of hyperglycemia.

AB  - Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common and costly condition to treat. Economic evaluations of health care often incorporate patient preferences for health outcomes using utilities. The objective of this study was to determine pooled utility-based quality of life (the numerical value attached to the strength of an individual's preference for a specific health outcome) by CKD treatment modality.Methods and Findings: We conducted a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression of peer-reviewed published articles and of PhD dissertations published through 1 December 2010 that reported utility-based quality of life (utility) for adults with late-stage CKD. Studies reporting utilities by proxy (e.g., reported by a patient's doctor or family member) were excluded. In total, 190 studies reporting 326 utilities from over 56,000 patients were analysed. There were 25 utilities from pre-treatment CKD patients, 226 from dialysis patients (haemodialysis, n = 163; peritoneal dialysis, n = 44), 66 from kidney transplant patients, and three from patients treated with non-dialytic conservative care. Using time tradeoff as a referent instrument, kidney transplant recipients had a mean utility of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.90). The mean utility was comparable in pre-treatment CKD patients (difference  =  -0.02; 95% CI: -0.09, 0.04), 0.11 lower in dialysis patients (95% CI: -0.15, -0.08), and 0.2 lower in conservative care patients (95% CI: -0.38, -0.01). Patients treated with automated peritoneal dialysis had a significantly higher mean utility (0.80) than those on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (0.72; p = 0.02). The mean utility of transplant patients increased over time, from 0.66 in the 1980s to 0.85 in the 2000s, an increase of 0.19 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.26). Utility varied by elicitation instrument, with standard gamble producing the highest estimates, and the SF-6D by Brazier et al., University of Sheffield, producing the lowest estimates. The main limitations of this study were that treatment assignments were not random, that only transplant had longitudinal data available, and that we calculated EuroQol Group EQ-5D scores from SF-36 and SF-12 health survey data, and therefore the algorithms may not reflect EQ-5D scores measured directly.Conclusions: For patients with late-stage CKD, treatment with dialysis is associated with a significant decrement in quality of life compared to treatment with kidney transplantation. These findings provide evidence-based utility estimates to inform economic evaluations of kidney therapies, useful for policy makers and in individual treatment discussions with CKD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic Kidney Disease is a major cause of morbidity and interventions now exist which can reduce risk. We sought to develop and validate two new risk algorithms (the QKidney Scores) for estimating (a) the individual 5 year risk of moderate-severe CKD and (b) the individual 5 year risk of developing End Stage Kidney Failure in a primary care population. METHODS: We conducted a prospective open cohort study using data from 368 QResearch general practices to develop the scores. We validated the scores using two separate sets of practices--188 separate QResearch practices and 364 practices contributing to the THIN database.We studied 775,091 women and 799,658 men aged 35-74 years in the QResearch derivation cohort, who contributed 4,068,643 and 4,121,926 person-years of observation respectively.We had two main outcomes (a) moderate-severe CKD (defined as the first evidence of CKD based on the earliest of any of the following: kidney transplant; kidney dialysis; diagnosis of nephropathy; persistent proteinuria; or glomerular filtration rate of < 45 mL/min) and (b) End Stage Kidney Failure.We derived separate risk equations for men and women. We calculated measures of calibration and discrimination using the two separate validation cohorts. RESULTS: Our final model for moderate-severe CKD included: age, ethnicity, deprivation, smoking, BMI, systolic blood pressure, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease, treated hypertension, congestive cardiac failure; peripheral vascular disease, NSAID use and family history of kidney disease. In addition, it included SLE and kidney stones in women. The final model for End Stage Kidney Failure was similar except it did not include NSAID use.Each risk prediction algorithms performed well across all measures in both validation cohorts. For the THIN cohort, the model to predict moderate-severe CKD explained 56.38% of the total variation in women and 57.49% for men. The D statistic values were high with values of 2.33 for women and 2.38 for men. The ROC statistic was 0.875 for women and 0.876 for men. CONCLUSIONS: These new algorithms have the potential to identify high risk patients who might benefit from more detailed assessment, closer monitoring or interventions to reduce their risk.

AB  - We outline the experience of Southern California Kaiser Permanente, a large integrated health maintenance organization, in implementing the chronic kidney disease (CKD) definition and staging guidelines of the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) from 2002 to 2008, including estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) implementation, algorithm for GFR range assignment and reassignment, and practical modifications of CKD staging for population management. We departed from the KDOQI CKD definition and staging as follows: for stages 1 to 2, we required 'macroproteinuria' rather than 'microalbuminuria' as the marker of kidney damage; for stage 3, we included individuals with macroproteinuria, diabetes mellitus based on diabetic registry, or eGFR + 1/2 age less than 85; and for stage 5, we included only individuals not receiving renal replacement therapy. In an adult population of 2.5 million members, we identified 2.9% (72,005) for CKD population management (0.1%, 0.2%, 1.7%, 0.15%, and 0.01% with stages 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively). Outpatient visits with a nephrologist in the past 12 months for the prevalent CKD population increased modestly from 2003 to 2008 from 20% to 24%. Nephrologists see a higher risk subset, including 77% of patients with stages 4 to 5, 45% of prevalent patients with CKD stages 1 to 5 with the last urine protein level greater than approximately 1 g, and 21% of patients with stage 3 in the past 12 months, but only 4% of patients with eGFR of 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m(2) not meeting our criteria for stage 3. Primary care providers see the majority of patients with stages 1 to 5 in the course of a year (85%) and are aware of kidney disease (79% coded for kidney disease). Other quality indicators during the 12-month window include the following: for patients with prevalent CKD stages 1 to 5, a total of 56% with last blood pressure greater than 129/79 mm Hg, 21% missing qualitative proteinuria, 16% missing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, 11% missing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 40% with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level greater than 100 mg/dL, 50% of patients with diabetes with hemoglobin A(1c) level of 7% or greater; for prevalent patients with CKD stages 3 to 5, a total of 14% missing hemoglobin level and 13% with hemoglobin level less than 11 mg/dL; and for prevalent patients with CKD stages 4 to 5, a total of 2.5 hospital d/patient and 62% not attending instructional classes for modalities of renal replacement therapy. Optimal start of end-stage renal disease therapy, defined as the proportion of patients with stages 4 to 5 who either started peritoneal dialysis therapy directly, started hemodialysis therapy using an arteriovenous fistula, or received a preemptive renal transplant, was 54%. Comprehensive CKD care is possible within a large health maintenance organization, but with substantial opportunity for improvement remaining. Copyright © 2009 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is recognised as a global public health problem, more prevalent in older persons and associated with multiple co-morbidities. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension are common aetiologies for CKD, but IgA glomerulonephritis, membranous glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are also common causes of CKD.Main Body: Conventional biomarkers for CKD involving the use of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) derived from four variables (serum creatinine, age, gender and ethnicity) are recommended by clinical guidelines for the evaluation, classification, and stratification of CKD. However, these clinical biomarkers present some limitations, especially for early stages of CKD, elderly individuals, extreme body mass index values (serum creatinine), or are influenced by inflammation, steroid treatment and thyroid dysfunction (serum cystatin C). There is therefore a need to identify additional non-invasive biomarkers that are useful in clinical practice to help improve CKD diagnosis, inform prognosis and guide therapeutic management.Conclusion: CKD is a multifactorial disease with associated genetic and environmental risk factors. Hence, many studies have employed genetic, epigenetic and transcriptomic approaches to identify biomarkers for kidney disease. In this review, we have summarised the most important studies in humans investigating genomic biomarkers for CKD in the last decade. Several genes, including UMOD, SHROOM3 and ELMO1 have been strongly associated with renal diseases, and some of their traits, such as eGFR and serum creatinine. The role of epigenetic and transcriptomic biomarkers in CKD and related diseases is still unclear. The combination of multiple biomarkers into classifiers, including genomic, and/or epigenomic, may give a more complete picture of kidney diseases.

AB  - Background: Transfusion-associated circulatory overload is characterized by new respiratory distress and hydrostatic pulmonary edema within 6 hours after blood transfusion, but its risk factors and outcomes are poorly characterized.Methods: Using a case control design, we enrolled 83 patients with severe transfusion-associated circulatory overload identified by active surveillance for hypoxemia and 163 transfused controls at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minn) hospitals. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using multivariable logistic regression, and survival and length of stay were analyzed using proportional hazard models.Results: Transfusion-associated circulatory overload was associated with chronic renal failure (OR 27.0; 95% CI, 5.2-143), a past history of heart failure (OR 6.6; 95% CI, 2.1-21), hemorrhagic shock (OR 113; 95% CI, 14.1-903), number of blood products transfused (OR 1.11 per unit; 95% CI, 1.01-1.22), and fluid balance per hour (OR 9.4 per liter; 95% CI, 3.1-28). Patients with transfusion-associated circulatory overload had significantly increased in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio 3.20; 95% CI, 1.23-8.10) after controlling for Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II (APACHE-II) score, and longer hospital and intensive care unit lengths of stay.Conclusions: The risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload increases with the number of blood products administered and a positive fluid balance, and in patients with pre-existing heart failure and chronic renal failure. These data, if replicated, could be used to construct predictive algorithms for transfusion-associated circulatory overload, and subsequent modifications of transfusion practice might prevent morbidity and mortality associated with this complication.

AB  - Background: As people diagnosed with HIV and receiving combination antiretroviral therapy are now living longer, they are likely to acquire chronic conditions related to normal ageing and the effects of HIV and its treatment. Comordidities for people with HIV have not previously been described from a representative population perspective.Methods: We used linked health administrative data from Ontario, Canada. We applied a validated algorithm to identify people with HIV among all residents aged 18 years or older between April 1, 1992 and March 31, 2009. We randomly selected 5 Ontario adults who were not identified with HIV for each person with HIV for comparison. Previously validated case definitions were used to identify persons with mental health disorders and any of the following physical chronic diseases: diabetes, congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension, asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, peripheral vascular disease and end-stage renal failure. We examined multimorbidity prevalence as the presence of at least two physical chronic conditions, or as combined physical-mental health multimorbidity. Direct age-sex standardized rates were calculated for both cohorts for comparison.Results: 34.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 33.6% to 35.2%) of people with HIV had at least one other physical condition. Prevalence was especially high for mental health conditions (38.6%), hypertension (14.9%) and asthma (12.7%). After accounting for age and sex differences, people with HIV had significantly higher prevalence of all chronic conditions except myocardial infarction and hypertension, as well as substantially higher multimorbidity (prevalence ratio 1.30, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.44) and combined physical-mental health multimorbidity (1.79, 95% CI 1.65 to 1.94). Prevalence of multimorbidity among people with HIV increased with age. The difference in prevalence of multimorbidity between the two cohorts was more pronounced among women.Conclusion: People living with HIV in Ontario, especially women, had higher prevalence of comorbidity and multimorbidity than the general population. Quantifying this morbidity at the population level can help inform healthcare delivery requirements for this complex population.

AB  - Background: Accurate and precise estimates of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are essential for clinical assessments, and many methods of estimation are available. We developed a radial basis function (RBF) network and assessed the performance of this method in the estimation of the GFRs of 207 patients with type-2 diabetes and CKD.Methods: Standard GFR (sGFR) was determined by (99m)Tc-DTPA renal dynamic imaging and GFR was also estimated by the 6-variable MDRD equation and the 4-variable MDRD equation.Results: Bland-Altman analysis indicated that estimates from the RBF network were more precise than those from the other two methods for some groups of patients. However, the median difference of RBF network estimates from sGFR was greater than those from the other two estimates, indicating greater bias. For patients with stage I/II CKD, the median absolute difference of the RBF network estimate from sGFR was significantly lower, and the P50 of the RBF network estimate (n = 56, 87.5%) was significantly higher than that of the MDRD-4 estimate (n = 49, 76.6%) (p < 0.0167), indicating that the RBF network estimate provided greater accuracy for these patients.Conclusions: In patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus, estimation of GFR by our RBF network provided better precision and accuracy for some groups of patients than the estimation by the traditional MDRD equations. However, the RBF network estimates of GFR tended to have greater bias and higher than those indicated by sGFR determined by (99m)Tc-DTPA renal dynamic imaging.

AB  - Background: Impaired kidney function is an established predictor of mortality after acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (ANVUGIB); however, which factors are associated with mortality after ANVUGIB among patients undergoing dialysis is unknown. We examined the associations among demographic characteristics, dialysis-specific features, and comorbid conditions with short-term mortality after ANVUGIB among patients on dialysis.Methods: Design: Retrospective cohort study.Setting: United States Renal Data System (USRDS), a nation-wide registry of patients with end-stage renal disease.Participants: All ANVUGIB episodes identified by validated algorithms in Medicare-covered patients between 2003 and 2007.Measurements: Demographic characteristics and comorbid conditions from 1 year of billing claims prior to each bleeding event. We used logistic regression extended with generalized estimating equations methods to model the associations among risk factors and 30-day mortality following ANVUGIB events.Results: From 2003 to 2007, we identified 40,016 eligible patients with 50,497 episodes of ANVUGIB. Overall 30-day mortality was 10.7% (95% CI: 10.4-11.0). Older age, white race, longer dialysis vintage, peritoneal dialysis (vs. hemodialysis), and hospitalized (vs. outpatient) episodes were independently associated with a higher risk of 30-day mortality. Most but not all comorbid conditions were associated with death after ANVUGIB. The joint ability of all factors captured to discriminate mortality was modest (c=0.68).Conclusions: We identified a profile of risk factors for 30-day mortality after ANVUGIB among patients on dialysis that was distinct from what had been reported in non-dialysis populations. Specifically, peritoneal dialysis and more years since initiation of dialysis were independently associated with short-term death after ANVUGIB.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: The results of recent clinical trials in early diabetic nephropathy demonstrate that current therapies designed to suppress microalbuminuria do not prevent renal function decline. However, recent observational studies refined the traditional model of early nephropathy in type 1 diabetes and may inform more effective therapies for the prevention of chronic kidney disease.Recent Findings: A contemporary model of early nephropathy in type 1 diabetes has emerged in which initiation of renal function decline occurs soon after the onset of microalbuminuria and is not conditional on progression to proteinuria. Early renal function decline can be diagnosed using serial measurement of serum cystatin C. Abnormal levels of markers of protein glycation, uric acid metabolism, and chronic inflammation appear to represent mechanisms unique to early renal function decline and distinct from those involved in microalbuminuria.Summary: Recent findings refine the existing paradigm of early nephropathy in type 1 diabetes and have significant implications for research. Clinical tests--such as an algorithm for the serial determination of serum cystatin C--should be developed for monitoring early renal function decline for use as an outcome in clinical trials.

AB  - Background: Administrative health care databases offer an efficient and accessible, though as-yet unvalidated, approach to studying outcomes of patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The objective of this study is to determine the validity of outpatient physician billing derived algorithms for defining chronic dialysis compared to a reference standard ESRD registry.Methods: A cohort of incident dialysis patients (Jan. 1-Dec. 31, 2008) and prevalent chronic dialysis patients (Jan 1, 2008) was selected from a geographically inclusive ESRD registry and administrative database. Four administrative data definitions were considered: at least 1 outpatient claim, at least 2 outpatient claims, at least 2 outpatient claims at least 90 days apart, and continuous outpatient claims at least 90 days apart with no gap in claims greater than 21 days. Measures of agreement of the four administrative data definitions were compared to a reference standard (ESRD registry). Basic patient characteristics are compared between all 5 patient groups.Results: 1,118,097 individuals formed the overall population and 2,227 chronic dialysis patients were included in the ESRD registry. The three definitions requiring at least 2 outpatient claims resulted in kappa statistics between 0.60-0.80 indicating "substantial" agreement. "At least 1 outpatient claim" resulted in "excellent" agreement with a kappa statistic of 0.81.Conclusions: Of the four definitions, the simplest (at least 1 outpatient claim) performed comparatively to other definitions. The limitations of this work are the billing codes used are developed in Canada, however, other countries use similar billing practices and thus the codes could easily be mapped to other systems. Our reference standard ESRD registry may not capture all dialysis patients resulting in some misclassification. The registry is linked to on-going care so this is likely to be minimal. The definition utilized will vary with the research objective.

AB  - Background: There are few long-term mortality prediction studies after acute aortic dissection (AAD) Type A and none were performed using new models such as neural networks (NN) or support vector machines (SVM) which may show a higher discriminatory potency than standard multivariable models.Methods: We used 32 risk factors identified by Literature search and previously assessed in short-term outcome investigations. Models were trained (50%) and validated (50%) on 2 random samples from a consecutive 235-patient cohort. NN were run only on patients with complete data for all included variables (N = 211); SVM on the overall group. Discrimination was assessed by receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) and Gini's coefficients along with classification performance.Results: There were 84 deaths (36%) occurring at 564 +/- 48 days (95%CI from 470 to 658 days). Patients with complete variables had a slightly lower death rate (60 of 211, 28%). NN classified 44 of 60 (73%) dead patients and 147 of 151 (97%) long-term survivors using 5 covariates: immediate post-operative chronic renal failure, circulatory arrest time, the type of surgery on ascending aorta plus hemi-arch, extracorporeal circulation time and the presence of Marfan habitus. Global accuracies of training and validation NN were excellent with AUC respectively 0.871 and 0.870 but classification errors were high among patients who died. Training SVM, using a larger number of covariates, showed no false negative or false positive cases among 118 randomly selected patients (error = 0%, AUC 1.0) whereas validation SVM, among 117 patients, provided 5 false negative and 11 false positive cases (error = 22%, AUC 0.821, p < 0.01 versus NN results). An html file was produced to adopt and manipulate the selected parameters for practical predictive purposes.Conclusions: Both NN and SVM accurately selected a few operative and immediate post-operative factors and the Marfan habitus as long-term mortality predictors in AAD Type A. Although these factors were not new per se, their combination may be used in practice to index death risk post-operatively with good accuracy.

AB  - Advanced age is one of the major determinants of frailty in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis. However, multiple other factors contribute to frailty in these patients. The identification of frailty in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis is critical as it influences the complexity of the anticoagulant treatment in this population at high risk of venous thromboembolism and bleeding. Factors that contribute to frailty in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis include age, type of cancer, comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease, poly-pharmacotherapy, treatment compliance, cognitive impairment, anemia, thrombocytopenia, mobility, nutritional status, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group grade, risk of falls, and reduced life expectancy. In the absence of specific clinical studies current anticoagulant treatment guidelines for the management are not fully applicable to frail patients with cancer. The anticoagulant treatment should therefore benefit from a tailored approach based on an algorithm that takes into account the specificities of the malignant disease.

AB  - Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated disorder that affects approximately 7.5 million people in the United States. Individuals with psoriasis may develop cutaneous, articular, and systemic manifestations, which are a source of significant morbidity and a heightened risk of mortality, and may adversely impact patient-reported quality of life measures. Psoriasis is now recognized as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, peripheral vascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, certain malignancies, and chronic renal disease. Therefore, it has become increasingly relevant that primary care physicians have a basic working knowledge and an understanding of fundamental management principles of psoriasis. This review highlights the salient clinical features of psoriasis and psoriatic spectrum disease, emphasizing key updates with respect to systemic disease and associated conditions, and briefly outlines a therapeutic algorithm for the primary care physician.

AB  - Background: Previously the angiotensin II receptor blocker Irbesartan has been demonstrated to reduce the risk for progression from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of treatment with Irbesartan in type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria on the urinary proteome.Methods: High-resolution capillary-electrophoresis coupled to mass-spectrometry (CE-MS) was used to profile the low-molecular-weight proteome in urine of a subgroup of patients from a two year randomized irbesartan versus placebo therapy trial, which included hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria on ongoing antihypertensive medication (IRMA2-substudy).Results: We demonstrate that the therapy with 300 mg Irbesartan daily over a period of two years results in significant changes of the urinary proteome. Both, a classifier developed previously that consists of urinary peptides indicative of chronic kidney disease, as well as several individual peptides changed significantly after treatment. These changes were not observed in the placebo-treated individuals. Most prominent are changes of urinary collagen fragments associated with progression of diabetic nephropathy, indicating normalization in urinary peptides.Conclusion: CE-MS analysis of urine enabled identification of peptides as potential surrogate markers for renoprotection in microalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients, which show persistent improvement after longterm treatment with Irbesartan. The results suggest that a major benefit of treatment by Irbesartan may be improvement of collagen turnover, reduction of fibrosis. They further suggest that urinary proteome analysis could be utilized to assess potential benefit of therapeutic intervention, providing statistically significant results even on a small population.

AB  - Background: The performance of the Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidity measures in predicting patient outcomes have been well validated with ICD-9 data but not with ICD-10 data, especially in disease specific patient cohorts. The objective of this study was to assess the performance of these two comorbidity measures in the prediction of in-hospital and 1 year mortality among patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes, chronic renal failure (CRF), stroke and patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Methods: A Canadian provincial hospital discharge administrative database was used to define 17 Charlson comorbidities and 30 Elixhauser comorbidities. C-statistic values were calculated to evaluate the performance of two measures. One year mortality information was obtained from the provincial Vital Statistics Department. Results: The absolute difference between ICD-9 and ICD-10 data in C-statistics ranged from 0 to 0.04 across five cohorts for the Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidity measures predicting inhospital or 1 year mortality. In the models predicting in-hospital mortality using ICD-10 data, the C-statistics ranged from 0.62 (for stroke) -- 0.82 (for diabetes) for Charlson measure and 0.62 (for stroke) to 0.83 (for CABG) for Elixhauser measure. Conclusion: The change in coding algorithms did not influence the performance of either the Charlson or Elixhauser comorbidity measures in the prediction of outcome. Both comorbidity measures were still valid prognostic indicators in the ICD-10 data and had a similar performance in predicting short and long term mortality in the ICD-9 and ICD-10 data.

AB  - Diagnostic and interventional radiographic procedures in critically ill patients commonly depend on iodinated contrast media and consequently pose the risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury. This is an important complication that accounts for a significant number of cases of hospital-acquired renal failure, with adverse effects on prognosis and healthcare costs. The epidemiology and pathogenesis of contrast-induced acute kidney injury, baseline renal function measurement, risk assessment, identification of high-risk patients, contrast medium use, and preventive strategies will be discussed in this article. An algorithm is suggested for the risk stratification and management of contrast-induced acute kidney injury as it relates to patients undergoing iodinated contrast exposure during critical illness. Contrast-induced acute kidney injury is likely to remain a significant challenge for intensivists in the future because the patient population is aging and chronic kidney disease and diabetes are becoming more common.

AB  - Nephropathy is one of the most common diabetic microvascular complications. Without specific intervention, patients with diabetes with microalbuminuria can progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within 10 to 20 years. At greater risk are ethnic minority populations that are disproportionately affected by diabetic nephropathy and subsequent complications. Early detection and treatment can attenuate the progression of nephropathy to ESRD, and a variety of screening techniques are used to this end. Microalbuminuria has been recognized as an early predictor of nephropathy and has become an important screening target. There are 3 common methods of screening used to detect microalbuminuria: measurement of albumin-tocreatinine ratio in random spot collection, a 24-hour urine collection with creatinine, and a timed (4 hour or overnight) collection. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may also predict progression of nephropathy because it can indicate underlying glomerular hyperfiltration and hypertension. Kidney function is best estimated by GFR, and the stages of chronic kidney disease are determined by respective GFR levels. GFR can be estimated with predictive equations or a 24-hour urine sample or measured directly using insulin. The National Kidney Foundation and the American Diabetes Association have developed clinical guidelines that detail a screening protocol to be used for patients with diabetes.
