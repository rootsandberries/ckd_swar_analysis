AB  - We propose gamAID, an exploratory, supervised nonnegative tensor factorization method that iteratively extracts phenotypes from tensors constructed from medical count data. Using data from diabetic patients who later on get diagnosed with chronic kidney disorder (CKD) as well as diabetic patients who do not receive a CKD diagnosis, we demonstrate the potential of gamAID to discover phenotypes that characterize patients who are at risk for developing a disease.

AB  - Electronic health records (EHR) represent a holistic overview of patients’ trajectories. Their increasing availability has fueled new hopes to leverage them and develop accurate risk prediction models for a wide range of diseases. Given the complex interrelationships of medical records and patient outcomes, deep learning models have shown clear merits in achieving this goal. However, a key limitation of current study remains their capacity in processing long sequences, and long sequence modelling and its application in the context of healthcare and EHR remains unexplored. Capturing the whole history of medical encounters is expected to lead to more accurate predictions, but the inclusion of records collected for decades and from multiple resources can inevitably exceed the receptive field of the most existing deep learning architectures. This can result in missing crucial, long-term dependencies. To address this gap, we present Hi-BEHRT, a hierarchical Transformer-based model that can significantly expand the receptive field of Transformers and extract associations from much longer sequences. Using a multimodal large-scale linked longitudinal EHR, the Hi-BEHRT exceeds the state-of-the-art deep learning models 1% to 5% for area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve and 1% to 8% for area under the precision recall (AUPRC) curve on average, and 2% to 8% (AUROC) and 2% to 11% (AUPRC) for patients with long medical history for 5-year heart failure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and stroke risk prediction. Additionally, because pretraining for hierarchical Transformer is not well-established, we provide an effective end-to-end contrastive pre-training strategy for Hi-BEHRT using EHR, improving its transferability on predicting clinical events with relatively small training dataset.

AB  - Objectives: There are approximately 660 000 end-stage renal disease patients in the USA, with hemodialysis (HD) the primary form of treatment. High ultrafiltration rates (UFRs) are associated with intradialytic hypotension, a complication associated with adverse clinical outcomes including mortality. Individualized UFR profiles could reduce the incidence of intradialytic hypotension. Methods: The patient's fluid dynamics during HD is described by a nonlinear model comprising intravascular and interstitial pools, whose parameters are given by the patient's estimated nominal parameter values with uncertainty ranges; the output measurement is hematocrit. We design UFR profiles that minimize the maximal UFR needed to remove a prescribed volume of fluid within a set time, with hematocrit not exceeding a specified time-varying critical profile. Results: We present a novel approach to design individualized UFR profiles, and give theoretical results guaranteeing that the system remains within a predefined physiologically plausible region and does not exceed a specified time-invariant critical hematocrit level for all parameters in the uncertainty ranges. We test the performance of our design using a real patient data example. The designed UFR maintains the system below a time-varying critical hematocrit profile in the example. Conclusion: Theoretical results and simulations show that our designed UFR profiles can remove the target amount of fluid in a given time period while keeping the hematocrit below a specified critical profile. Significance: Individualization of UFR profiles is now feasible using current HD technology and may reduce the incidence of intradialytic hypotension.

AB  - Video encryption is a suitable method to protect video data. There are some disadvantages in the algorithms proposed before. In this paper, we propose a novel fast MPEG video encryption algorithm, which encrypts run length codes with chaotic run-length encryption algorithm (CREA), encrypts the signs of motion vectors with security-enhanced chaotic stream cipher (SECSC) and distributes keys with chaotic key distributor (CKD) at the same time. Its security, compression ratio and computational complexity are analyzed in details. Experimental results show that, the algorithm has less effect on compression ratio than the algorithms confusing DCT coefficients do, does not change file format, and is of low cost. Thus, it is suitable for secure video encoding with real-time requirement.

AB  - Conventional dialysis therapy ofpatients with end-stage renal disease is time-consuming and its discontinuous nature induces physiological stress to the patient. Therefore new emerging approaches facilitate prolonged treatment by using portable devices in home-settings. Such unsupervised treatment calls for continuous automated monitoring of various physiological parameters. This paper highlights the challenges of autonomous personalized renal treatment and presents a leap towards contextaware monitoring in data streams by a physiological modelbased approach. The algorithmic principle is employed to propagate urea concentration, which is measured to assess dialysis efficacy. Simulation results validate the algorithm for the application in a mobile dialysis therapy currently under development. The presented method enables the estimation of medically significant, but technically inaccessible physiological parameters from data stream propagation.

AB  - Hemodialysis is one of the treatments for patients with end-stage renal disease. The quality of dialysate scheme directly affects the prognosis of dialysis patients. In order to achieve the goal of making individualized dialysate scheme for dialysis patients, improve the decision-making efficiency of doctors and reduce the decision-making pressure, a dialysate decision-making model based on deep learning was studied and proposed. In this model, the bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) is used to study the multi-dimensional temporal physiological records of dialysis patients in both positive and negative directions, capturing the physiological characteristic information of patients. Besides, we introduce the attention mechanism, in order to capture the important information of time points, which enhances the interpretability of the model. Experiments show that this model has higher macro precision, macro recall and macro F1 than other models.

AB  - The external administration of recombinant human erythropoietin is the chosen treatment for those patients with secondary anemia due to chronic renal failure in periodic hemodialysis. The objective of this paper is to carry out an individualized prediction of the EPO dosage to be administered to those patients. The high cost of this medication, its side-effects and the phenomenon of potential resistance which some individuals suffer all justify the need for a model which is capable of optimizing dosage individualization. A group of 110 patients and several patient factors were used to develop the models. The support vector regressor (SVR) is benchmarked with the classical multilayer perceptron (MLP) and the Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) model. We introduce a priori knowledge by relaxing or tightening the /spl epsiv/-insensitive region and the penalization parameter depending on the time period of the patients' follow-up. The so-called profile-dependent SVR (PD-SVR) improves results of the standard SVR method and the MLP. We perform sensitivity analysis on the MLP and inspect the distribution of the support vectors in the input and feature spaces in order to gain knowledge about the problem.

AB  - Objective: clinic research information sharing system was designed and invented by National Chinese Medicine Scientific Academy, which provided great convenience for clinical research. To assess the effect of characteristic therapy of Chinese medicine in rehabilitation of chronic kidney disease patients, data mining in a single TCM hospital was conducted. Methods: clinical information of CKD patients were imputed and stored in the information sharing system in a structured way. Patients' information can be communicated via the information sharing system and the hospital HIS interface. Using the ETL tools, data including the diagnosis of TCM syndrome, results of laboratory tests, scores of TCM symptoms and treatment plan were exported from the information sharing system. Then, the data after selecting were transferred into EXCEL form. Results: 333 CKD patients were included. 201 cases were males (60.4%) versus 132 cases of female (39.6%). 92 patients were eliminated because of missing data. 241 cases remained for statistic analysis, including 147 of male (61%) and 94 cases of female (39%). There were 58 cases in CKD stage 3 (24.1%), 64 cases in stage 4 (26.6%) and 119 cases of stage 5 (49.4%). During hospitalization, scores of TCM syndromes and results of laboratory tests of CKD patients were improved after treatment of integration of Chinese and western medicine (P<;0.05). Comparing with the laboratory results of admission, GLU, BUN, SCR, UA, TCO2, 24 hours urine protein, urine WBC, urine BLD and eGFR were significantly improved. We selected eGFR as the primary endpoint for further analysis in order to find out the effective treatment for rehabilitation and to analyze the effect of TCM characteristic therapy in rehabilitation. The eGFR was the dependent variable, indicators with significant difference between the two groups (eGFR rising group and declining group) as the independent variable. Two variables were analyzed in logistic regression analysis in Forward: LR way. Results showed that drugs to correct acidosis, Chinese patent medicine to tonify the kidney and spleen and discharge toxin, external application with fructus evodiae, Tongluobao were the beneficial factors to improve eGFR in CKD patients. Conclusion: This system help clinicians easily, quickly and effectively to collect routine clinical data for research analysis. It is an integration of clinic research system worthy to be widely used. On the other hand, the results also indicated that, the characteristic therapy of TCM including Chinese patent medicine, external application with fructus evodiae, Tongluobao were the independent beneficial factors to improve eGFR in CKD patients.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease is a very prevalent ailment in the world; National Kidney Foundation of South Africa estimated that about 15% of the population in South Africa experience kidney disease and about 20,000 yearly reported cases and several thousands die untimely due to this disease. Application of Artifical Intelligence (AI) techniques to our day-to-day lives is bring positive changes, from banking to health carem military, gaming, welfare and so on. Scholars have worked extensively on Chronic Kidney Diseases (CKD) and most of their works are on pure statistical models thereby creating a lot of gaps for Machine Learning (ML) based model to explore. In this paper, we will review existing techniques, and propose a better technique based on Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model with a combination of three feature selection technique for a fast and accurate diagnosis of CKD with relevant symptoms. The CKD model developed in this paper has an accuracy of 0.976, which is better than the baseline models currently existing. Also, the sensitivity and specificity of the CKD model for 36 patients is 1.0 and 0.917 respectively. False diagnosis of CKD patients using this model is reduced greatly. The proposed model will reduce the cost of diagnosing CKD and it can be easily embedded in a CDSS.

AB  - End-Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD) patients on hemodialysis suf-fer from kidney failure, with the inability to remove excess fluid causing fluid overload. This can cause many morbidities, and is one of the most insidious and common risk factors for mortality in ESKD patients. Existing solutions for fluid intake monitoring such as self-report and weight gain monitoring are burdensome, non-continuous, and usually administered in clinics only. It is then critical to develop a ubiquitous fluid intake monitoring system to help ESKD patients better control their fluid consumption. In this study, we propose to leverage smartwatch sensor data (e.g., Photoplethysmography (PPG), Gyroscope, etc.) combined with a temporal sensor relation graph neural network (TSR-GNN) to predict fluid intake given past sensing data between two dialysis sessions. Our empirical experiments highlight promising findings about the feasibility of using ubiquitous sensing to predict fluid intake, and demonstrate that the proposed model TSR-GNN outperforms the selected baseline models in both accuracy and robustness. Additionally, an in-depth analysis of model interpretability by attention weights and GNNExplainer variant is conducted to better under-stand the inter-sensor interactions and sensor contributions to the fluid intake prediction results.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the leading medical ailments in developing countries. Due to the limited healthcare infrastructure and the lack of trained human resources, the CKD problem aggravates if it is not addressed in its earlier stages. In this regard, the role of machine learning-based automated diagnosis systems plays a vital role to deal with the CKD problem. In most of the studies conducted on the automated CKD decision modeling, the main emphasis is given to enhancing the predictive accuracy of the system. In this study, we focus on the applicability challenges of automated decision systems taking CKD diagnosis as a case study within the purview of developing countries. In this regard, we propose a cost-sensitive ensemble feature ranking method that takes a more realistic approach to group-based feature selection. Two candidate solutions are proposed for group-based feature selection to meet different objectives. Subsequently, both the candidate solutions are combined into a consolidated solution. It is pertinent to note that it is one of the first studies in which cost-sensitive ensemble feature ranking for non-overlapping groups is successfully demonstrated to achieve the stated objectives i.e. low-cost and high-accuracy solution. Based on an extensive set of experiments, we demonstrate that a cost-effective and accurate solution for the CKD problem can be obtained. The experimentation includes 7 well-known classification algorithms and 8 comparative feature selection methods to show the efficacy of the proposed approach. It is concluded that the applicability of the automated CKD systems can be enhanced by including the cost consideration into the objective space of the solution formulation. Therefore, a trade-off solution can be obtained that is cost-effective and yet accurate enough to serve as a CKD screening system.

AB  - Non-communicable diseases have become a major health concern in India. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) a non-communicable disease is one of the major causes of death. Identifying CKD at early stage is better to slow down the growth of disease that also decreases the chances of other complication. The aim of this work is to develop CBR application for diagnosis of chronic kidney disease and uses similarity-based retrieval of case results.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore pathophysiological mechanisms present in patients that suffer from Chronic Kidney Disease complicated by Metabolic Syndrome (CKD-MetS) so as to better support proactive treatment. Association rule mining was applied to extract significant associations from the Semantic MEDLINE Database (SemMedDB). A total of 23,310 PMIDs with 5,542 unique items were included in our dataset. We focused on 5 specific syndromes that were extracted: diabetes, cardiovascular disease, increased triglycerides, obesity and inflammation. The number of rules generated for these five diseases are SO, 197, 31, 21 and 21 respectively. Our study identified several pathophysiological mechanisms that exist in CKD-MetS patients that can contribute to further renal damage.

AB  - Objective: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a serious medical condition characterized by gradual loss of kidney function. Early detection and diagnosis is mandatory for adequate therapy and prognostic improvement. Hence, in the current pilot study we explore the use of image registration methods for detecting renal morphologic changes in patients with CKD. Methods: Ten healthy volunteers and nine patients with presumed CKD underwent dynamic T1 weighted imaging without contrast agent. From real and simulated dynamic time series, kidney deformation fields were estimated using a poroelastic deformation model. From the deformation fields several quantitative parameters reflecting pressure gradients, and volumetric and shear deformations were computed. Eight of the patients also underwent a kidney biopsy as a gold standard. Results: We found that the absolute deformation, normalized volume changes, as well as pressure gradients correlated significantly with arteriosclerosis from biopsy assessments. Furthermore, our results indicate that current image registration methodologies are lacking sensitivity to recover mild changes in tissue stiffness. Conclusion: Image registration applied to dynamic time series correlated with structural renal changes and should be further explored as a tool for invasive measurements of arteriosclerosis. Significance: Under the assumption that the proposed framework can be further developed in terms of sensitivity and specificity, it can provide clinicians with a non-invasive tool of high spatial coverage available for characterization of arteriosclerosis and potentially other pathological changes observed in chronic kidney disease.

AB  - Caring for elderly patients with end-stage renal disease is a pressing issue worldwide. In Canada, transplanting elderly patients has high upfront costs to the health care system. In this study we used machine learning to identify high-cost users of health care among deceased-donor renal transplant recipients aged over 70 in Ontario, Canada. Three classification methods were explored, including K-nearest neighbors, logistic lasso regression, and random forest. Insights offered by this study have implications that can aid renal programs to cost-effectively optimize outcomes of elderly patients.

T2  - 2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Connected Health: Applications, Systems and Engineering Technologies (CHASE)
AB  - The increasing adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems has brought tremendous opportunities in medicine enabling more personalized prognostic models. However, most work to date has investigated the binary classification problem for predicting the onset of one chronic disease, but little attention has been given to assessing risk of developing comorbidities that are major causes of morbidity and mortality. For example, type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease frequently accompany congestive heart failure. This paper is motivated by the problem of predicting comorbid diseases and aims to answer the following question: can we predict the comorbid risk using a patient's medical history? We propose a new predictive learning framework, Heterogeneous Convolutional Neural Network (HCNN), that represents EHRs as graphs with heterogeneous attributes (e.g. diagnoses, procedures, and medication), and then develop a novel deep learning methodology for risk prediction of multiple comorbid diseases. The main innovation of the framework is that it defines the distance between the heterogeneous attributes of the graph representation extracted from the EHR and develops an appropriate learning infrastructure that is a composition of sparse convolutional layers and local pooling steps that match with the local structure of the space of the heterogeneous attributes. As a result, the new method is capable of capturing features about the relationships between heterogeneous attributes of the graphs. Through a comparative study on patient EHR data, HCNN achieves better performance than traditional convolutional neural networks on the risk prediction of comorbid diseases.

AB  - Metabolic profiling, the study of changes in the concentration of the metabolites in the organism induced by biological differences within subpopulations, has to deal with a very large amount of complex data. It therefore requires the use of powerful data processing and machine learning methods. To overcome over-fitting, a common concern in metabolic profiling where the number of features is often much larger than the number of observations, many predictive analyses combined dimension reduction techniques with multivariate predictive linear modeling. Moreover, they built a global model that identifies biomarkers predictive of the output of interest giving their overall trend variations. However, this fails to capture local biological phenomena underlying subgroups of subjects. More recently, local exploration methods based on decision trees approaches have been applied in metabolomics but they only explore random parts of the feature space. In this study, we used a supervised rule-mining algorithm that locally and exhaustively explores the feature space to predict chronic kidney disease (CDK) stages based on proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) data. From the discriminant subregions obtained with this exploration, we extracted local features and learned a L2-regularized Logistic regression (L2LR) classifier. We compared the resulting local predictive model with a standard one, combining classical univariate supervised feature selection techniques with a L2LR, and a model mixing both global and local features. Results show that the local predictive model is more powerful in terms of predictive performance than the mixed and global models. Additionally, it gives key insights into biological variations specific to subgroups of subjects.

T2  - 2017 2nd International Conference on Computing and Communications Technologies (ICCCT)
AB  - Kidney disease is become a popular disease in around the world. The prediction of kidney disease is highly complex task while handling huge dataset. The kidney disease dataset contain patients information such as age, blood Pressure levels, albumin, sugar, counts of red blood cells etc., in the dataset there may be some missing values in some features that values may be important to predict kidney disease. Due to such missing values in the dataset will decrease the accuracy of kidney disease prediction. Several methods were proposed to fill up these missing values. An existing classification framework used a data preprocessing method but here the data cleaning process has been made in order to fill the missing values and to correct the erroneous ones. A recalculation process is performed on the chronic Kidney disease (CKD) stages and the values were recalculated and filled in for unknown values. Though this method is efficient, the influence of expert in the field of healthcare dataset values for CKD is needed. So to avoid this need and improve the preprocessing as a layman, Weighted Average Ensemble Learning Imputation (WAELI) is proposed. In this proposed work the single value imputation model used expectation-maximization (EM) and Random Forest (RF) which predict the missing values effectively in small dataset. For huge dataset the multiple value imputation model predict the missing values with the help of RF, Classification And Regression Tree, C4.5 are used to estimate the missing value. Hence the accuracy of kidney disease prediction will be improved by using WAELI. Then introducing priority assigning algorithm to assign priority for each features in the dataset then higher priority features are carried over for classification process. This makes classification process more efficient and time consumption for classification will be reduced.

We demonstrate that an optimal dosing strategy for ESA can be derived using Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques. In this study, we show some preliminary results of using a batch RL method, called Fitted Q-Iteration, to derive optimal ESA dosing strategies from retrospective treatment data. Presented results show that such dosing strategies are superior to a standard ESA protocol employed by our dialysis facilities.

TI  - The Neural Network of One-Dimensional Convolution-An Example of the Diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy
AU  - Y. Sun
T2  - IEEE Access
AB  - Diabetes is a serious threat to health development, because diabetes is a disease that caused most other diseases (complications). Diabetic retinopathy is the most important manifestation of diabetic microangiopathy and is also one of the most common complications in people with diabetes. At present, the diagnosis of diabetic retinal complications mainly depends on the pictures for diagnosis. The fundus images are the main ways to diagnose retinal diseases at present, but the diagnosis process is complicated. Based on this, this paper uses the electronic medical record information of 301 hospitalized patients with diabetes from 2009 to 2013, mainly using the diabetes diagnostic data, diabetes glycosylation data and diabetes biochemical test data, the depth of learning methods and medical diabetes combined with the application of convolution Neural Network Method (CNN) to build a diagnostic model, and thus draw the diagnosis. The main contribution of this study is twofold: 1) In this paper, we apply the CNN method to one-dimensional unrelated data sets and solve the problem of how to do one-dimensional irrelevant data convolution. 2) In this paper, the CNN model is combined with the BN layer to prevent the dispersion of the gradient, speed up the training speed and improve the accuracy of the model. In addition, this model incorporates an adaptive learning rate algorithm and optimizes the model. The experiments show that this method can achieve a training accuracy of 99.85% and a testing accuracy of 97.56%, which is more than 2% higher than that of using logistic regression. The model methods involved in this study can not only be used for the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, but also for the diagnosis of other diseases, such as chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular diseases.

AB  - Quantitative Increasing number of patients is affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD) world while with ensuing end-stage renal disease (ESRD). A change in global approach to CKD from costly treatment of ESRD to more aggressive primary and secondary prevention is imperative. This improvement needs: a better understanding of mechanisms underlying renal scarring, a development of specific therapies to slow the progression and a development of modern diagnostic tools to characterize these underlying processes. Number of patients with ESRD underestimates CKD has probably exceeded by a factor 50 this last ten years due to initiation factors as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, obesity or smoking. In this work, the Supersonic Shear Imaging technique (SSI) was proved to be able to provide a quantitative follow up of kidney fibrosis on rats. Then, the technique was adapted on curved probes and proposed to map the in vivo viscoelastic properties of human renal transplants and compared with biopsy. The SSI technique is based on the radiation force induced by a conventional ultrasonic probe, to generate a planar shear wave deep into tissues. Then shear wave propagation throughout the medium is caught in real time thanks to an ultrafast ultrasound scanner (5000 frames/s). At last, a time of flight algorithm applied on these data allows to compute a map of the shear wave velocity of the kidney. A follow up study of 8 weeks on a model of glomerulosclerosis induced by L-Name on 50 rats has been conducted in order to investigate the accuracy of the technique. Quantitative maps of the kidney cortex were performed with an 8 MHz linear probe. Regarding human renal transplants, quantitative maps of the cortex elasticity were produced for each patient with a 2.5 MHz curved array. In the animal study the results show an increase of the elasticity of the cortex of the kidney in time with a Young's modulus ranging from 9 to 25 kPa. Results are compared to histological measurement as proteinuria and or quantification of fibrosis with trichrome. On human renal transplants, three groups were studied: a control group, subjects with an early or with a late unfunctional transplant. The results obtained using a curved ultrasonic probe show an 8 cm depth by 10 cm width map of the Young's modulus for the 49 patients. Elasticity varies between groups from 9 to 50 kPa. Results were compared to histology and showed a good agreement between fibrosis markers and Young's modulus. Here we have demonstrated the feasibility of inducing shear waves using the supersonic shear imaging technique in vivo in rats and human kidneys. The good reproducibility and accuracy of the shear elasticity are discussed. The elasticity was proved to be clearly related to kidney fibrosis. As fibrotic process is responsible for the development of most CKD, noninvasive identification and follow-up of this process could improve renal prognosis if adapted targeted therapies can be applied.

AB  - Ischemic stroke has been known to convert to Hemorrhagic stroke with ease. It is crucial to identify high risk patients with relevant diseases. This study uses the Taiwan National Health Insurance database to collate and analyze the relevant diseases leading to Hemorrhagic from Ischemic stroke. We propose several novel machine learning based algorithms and indexing methods for disease transformation prediction and accuracy enhancements. They are a modified swarm algorithm, partial least square(PLS) algorithm and genetic algorithms. From the petition application files accumulated from 2006 to 2013 within the National Health Insurance Database, 8,483 patients with ischemic stroke is collected. Among them, the 1,145 patients with both ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke were screened according to the ICD-9-CM diagnostic code. The disease history of each patient is vectorized and stacked into a matrix for analysis. The PLS/GA process is then applied on the disease history matrix, trying to filter out the candidate diseases leading to such transformation. A total of 750 diseases were found to be associated with ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke through the PLS/GA process. A modified PSO algorithm is developed to further weight these selected diseases. A quartile rule is then applied to filter these weighted diseases to ten most influential diseases which are dizziness, constipation, chronic renal failure, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, anxiety, muscle pain, prostatic hypertrophy, etc. In addition to normally known diseases to such conversion in the literature such as hypertension and diabetes, we also discovered more potential diseases. The initial analysis accuracy of our proposed methods reaches 86% on average, while that of the traditional Neural Network algorithm utilizing the same training data was only 49.5%.

AB  - Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is common and harmful disorder in hospitalized patients. It is associated with poor outcomes such as a decrease chance of survival, longer hospital stays and an increase progression of chronic kidney disease. To diagnosis AKI, the KDIGO clinical practice guideline has been published for providing standardized criteria of AKI definition and the recommendation in medical pathway. Moreover, early detection of AKI in patient at risk can also improve the outcomes. This paper presents an approach to assist the doctor in diagnosis and decision making process. First, the risk factors of AKI were identified using data mining approach based on Decision Tree classification technique. Simple Cart and J48 were selected as the algorithms for this process. Second, a concept of tool requirements and design named “AKIHelper” is presented. This tool is created based on KDIGO guideline which is expected to use for diagnosis and staging severity of AKI.

AB  - Real-world datasets, particularly Electronic Health Records, are routinely found to be mixed (comprised of both categorical and continuous variables) and/or missing in nature. Such datasets present peculiar challenges related both to their clustering and the evaluation of the clusterings obtained. In this paper, we discuss these challenges in detail, as well as the solution approaches applied to them in the literature. We then apply some of these approaches to a multi-racial Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) dataset comprising of 20 continuous and 12 categorical variables with an over 30% missingness ratio, evaluating our results through external and internal validation as well as cluster stability testing. From the results of our study, the Ahmad-Dey distance measure consistently outperformed Gower's distance on our mixed and missing dataset. In addition, our results show that advanced imputation methods like multiple imputation, which take into consideration the uncertainty inherent in imputation, should be explored when clustering missing datasets. Three clusters were identified from our dataset which were significantly differentiated by age, sex, estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), creatinine, urea, and hemoglobin, but not by race or blood pressure. The fact that, through proper cluster analysis, we were unable to identify five clusters corresponding to the five CKD stages usually used to classify CKD patients indicates that datasets with more than the usual four/six variables used for computing eGFR may contain a latent structure different from this five-group structure, the identification of which will provide valuable insights peculiar to each cohort for medical practitioners.

We identify a key issue in the way such recurrent neural network models are being currently used and show that the solution of the issue leads to significant improvements in the learnt representations on both synthetic and real datasets. A detailed analysis of the improved methodology for representing patients suffering from Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using clinical data is provided. Experimental results show that the proposed T-LSTM model is able to capture the long-term trends in the data, while effectively handling the noise in the signal. Finally, we show that by using the latent representations of the CKD patients obtained from the T-LSTM autoencoder, one can identify unusual patient profiles from the target population.

The main challenge to face in this problem is the highly unbalanced classes that may lead to a poor performance in the classification, this work proposes a way to balance classes in order to circumvent that problem. Achieved results show that several factors emerged as the main factors of mortality in this population with a high cardiovascular (CV) risk, besides age and gender, treatments for hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia are the most relevant factors present in the cohort although the weight of each of them varies with the model. Despite the variation among the models, treatment for hypertension seems to be the most relevant factor.

The most common complications are eye damage, kidney diseases and heart problems. The treatment for these complications will be visual impairment for eye damage, chemical analysis for kidney diseases and may even end up to loss of life for heart problems. Identifying this disease is a monotonous task starts at diabetis testing center and ends up at doctor for further treatment. Issues related to kidneys are also a most common disease which affects the kidneys and weakens the body’s potential. Symptoms of CKD include nerve injury, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, and anemia. Treatment must be started at a prior stage to maintain proper chronic uropathy levels. The cost for predication of CKD is high. The main objective of this paper is to develop a new method to detect diabetes, kidney issues with Random forest classifier. Prediction outcome of various methods state that these algorithms predict very efficiently and instantly.

AB  - By combining two fast training methods, i.e, the weights-direct-determination (WDD) method and Levenberg-Marquardt method, this paper proposes a novel training algorithm called weights and structure policy (WASP) for the three-layer feedforward neuronet, in addition to the algorithm of weights and structure determination (WASD). Note that the pruning-while-growing and second-pruning techniques are developed and exploited in the WASP algorithm with the aim of achieving a neuronet with a simple and economical structure. In order to verify the WASP efficacy and to address the problem of chronic kidney disease (CKD) for clinical applications in China, numerical experiments about estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by the WASP neuronet and traditional GFR-estimation equations are conducted and compared. The experiment results show that the WASP training speed is fast and that the estimating accuracy via the WASP neuronet is around 20% higher than those via traditional GFR-estimation equations. The WASP efficacy is thus demonstrated with a significant value in GFR estimation of CKD for clinical applications.

AB  - This study establishes interoperability among electronic medical records from 800 clinical sites and uses machine learning for best practice discovery. A novel extraction-mapping algorithm is designed that accurately extracts, summarizes, and maps free text and content to concise structured medical concepts. Multiple concepts are mapped, including patient diagnoses, laboratory results, medications, and procedures, which allow shared characterization and hierarchical comparison. In addition, clinical and decision processes are established. These integrated data can be accessed through a secure web-based portal. A classification machine learning model (DAMIP) is then leveraged to establish predictive rules by uncovering relatively small subsets of discriminatory features that can predict the quality of treatment outcomes. We demonstrate system usability by analyzing treatment outcome for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. DAMIP yields good blind prediction accuracies of 89% – 97%. Moreover, for each disease the best practice was only used at fewer than 5% of the clinical sites, offering an excellent opportunity for knowledge sharing and rapid learning. Our findings also led to implementation of a new treatment policy for chronic kidney disease management. This resulting policy offers a better outcome for patients, saves lives, improves the quality of life for patients, and reduces 35% of treatment costs. Thus, this work has critical health practice implications. Through data-driven interoperability and predictive analytics, we have established and identified practice characteristics that result in good outcomes. The system is scalable and generalizable to different hospital settings and health conditions.

AB  - Intervention in the early stages of cardiovascular and kidney diseases is proven to be more effective in preventing disease progression. Large artery stiffness measurement can be a potential early predictor of future risks. The purpose of the study reported in this work was to demonstrate the feasibility of our ARTSENS® Pen device as a high-throughput vascular screening tool for risk assessment. The study was performed during a medical camp conducted for awareness and early-stage detection of kidney diseases. Screening procedures included biosample tests and blood pressure measurements. Alongside, various clinically relevant measures of the arterial stiffness were evaluated using the ARTSENS® Pen, by measuring vessel wall dynamics via our proprietary image-free ultrasound algorithms. Stiffness measurement from the left common carotid artery on 85 participants could be completed within 4 hours, employing two units of ARTSENS® Pen; this also includes time taken for all the procedures enlisted in the study protocol. The associations of carotid stiffness indices with age-, gender-, and risk factor-dependent variations were established.

TI  - Cascaded Regression Neural Nets for Kidney Localization and Segmentation-free Volume Estimation
AU  - M. A. Hussain

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging
AB  - Kidney volume is an essential biomarker for a number of kidney disease diagnoses, for example, chronic kidney disease. Existing total kidney volume estimation methods often rely on an intermediate kidney segmentation step. On the other hand, automatic kidney localization in volumetric medical images is a critical step that often precedes subsequent data processing and analysis. Most current approaches perform kidney localization via an intermediate classification or regression step. This paper proposes an integrated deep learning approach for (i) kidney localization in computed tomography scans and (ii) segmentation-free renal volume estimation. Our localization method uses a selection-convolutional neural network that approximates the kidney inferior-superior span along the axial direction. Cross-sectional (2D) slices from the estimated span are subsequently used in a combined sagittal-axial Mask-RCNN that detects the organ bounding boxes on the axial and sagittal slices, the combination of which produces a final 3D organ bounding box. Furthermore, we use a fully convolutional network to estimate the kidney volume that skips the segmentation procedure. We also present a mathematical expression to approximate the `volume error' metric from the `Sørensen-Dice coefficient.' We accessed 100 patients' CT scans from the Vancouver General Hospital records and obtained 210 patients' CT scans from the 2019 Kidney Tumor Segmentation Challenge database to validate our method. Our method produces a kidney boundary wall localization error of ~2.4mm and a mean volume estimation error of ~5%.

AB  - Sleep apnea (SA) is a common sleep disorder that occurs during sleep and its symptom is the reduction or disappearance of respiratory airflow caused by upper airway collapse. The SA would cause a variety of diseases like diabetes, chronic kidney disease, depression, cardiovascular diseases, or even sudden death. Early detecting SA and intervention can help individuals to prevent malignant events induced by SA. In this study, we propose a multi-scaled fusion network named SEMSCNN for SA detection based on single-lead ECG signals acquired from wearable devices. The proposed SE-MSCNN mainly has two modules: multi-scaled convolutional neural network (CNN) module and channel-wise attention module. To utilize adjacent ECG segments information to facilitate the SA detection performance, the multi-scaled CNN module consists of three streams of shallow neural networks with segments with various length as inputs to extract different scaled features. To overcome the problem of feature information local concentration for feature fusion with concatenation, a channel-wise attention module with squeeze-to-excitation block is employed to fuse the different scaled features adaptively. Experiment results on PhysioNet Apnea-ECG dataset show that the proposed SE-MSCNN can achieve the best per-segment accuracy of 90.64 % and the best per-recording accuracy of 100 %, which is superior to state-of-the-art SA detection methods with a big margin. The SE-MSCNN with merits of quick response and lightweight parameters can be potentially embedded to a wearable device to provide a SA detection service for individuals in home sleep test.

AB  - Machine learning has earned a remarkable position in healthcare sector because of its capability to enhance the disease prediction in healthcare sector. Artificial intelligence and Machine learning techniques are being used in healthcare sector. Nowadays, one of the world's crucial health related problem is kidney disease. It is increasing day by day because of not maintaining proper food habits, drinking less amount of water and lack of health consciousness. So we need some technique that will continuously monitor health condition effectively. Here, we have proposed an approach for real time kidney disease prediction, monitoring and application (KDPMA). Our aim is to find an optimized and efficient machine learning (ML) technique that can effectively recognize and predict the condition of chronic kidney disease. In this work, we used ten most popular machine learning technique to predict kidney disease. In this process, the data has been divided into two sections. In one section train dataset got trained and another section got evaluated by test dataset. The analysis results show that Decision Tree Classifier and Gaussian Naive Bayes achieved highest performance than the other classifiers, obtaining the accuracy score of 100% and 1 recall(Sensitivity) score. Now we are developing mobile application based on the best output results classifier technique to predict Kidney Disease from patient report.

AB  - As the healthcare industry becomes more reliant upon electronic records, the amount of medical data available for analysis increases exponentially. While this information contains valuable statistics, the sheer volume makes it difficult to analyze without efficient algorithms. By using machine learning to classify medical data, diagnoses can become more efficient, accurate, and accessible for the public. After choosing k-Nearest Neighbors for its simplicity, we applied it to datasets compiled by the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository to diagnose two conditions - chronic kidney failure and heart disease - with an accuracy of approximately 90%. In the future, similar methods can be used on a larger scale to bring ease of use to the field of medical diagnostics.

AB  - Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs when a patient cannot maintain fluid homeostasis because of acute deterioration in renal function. Several studies have indicated that patients with AKI have higher risks for developing chronic kidney disease and mortality compared with patients without AKI. Although AKI is a serious disorder, few studies have identified the diseases that cause AKI. The purpose of this study was to identify the diseases associated with AKI. METHODS The data of 68,504 hospitalized patients at Kochi Medical School Hospital from 1981 to 2010 were analyzed. All laboratory test results were automatically processed and saved in a hospital information system database. Episodes of AKI were identified by the serum creatinine level as defined by Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. All diseases that were diagnosed within 30 days prior to the development of AKI were collected from the hospital information system database. Compared with patients who were not affected with AKI, the odds ratios were calculated, and a multivariate analysis was conducted. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The highest odds ratio was AKI (odds ratio 46.44, 95% confidence interval 36.88-58.49) This means that our method has enough usability and validity to identify the diseases associated with a high risk for AKI. In addition, cardiovascular diseases (e.g., shock syndrome), respiratory diseases (e.g., pneumonia), and infection diseases (e.g., septicemia) showed high odds ratio for AKI as expected (odds ratio 4.44, 95% confidence interval 4.07-4.84; odds ratio 2.38, 95% confidence interval 2.23-2.56; odds ratio 4.54, 95% confidence interval 4.17-4.93 respectively). Furthermore, hyperuricemia also had a significant odds ratio (odds ratio 1.79, 95% confidence interval 1.62-1.98). Few studies have shown a relationship between AKI and hyperuricemia. This study identified not only diseases expected to be risks for AKI, but also diseases that have never been regarded as risks for AKI.

AB  - The number of people diagnosed with advanced stages of kidney disease has been rising every year. Although early diagnosis and treatment can slow, if not stop, the progression of the disease, many lower income individuals are unable to afford the high cost of frequent testing necessary to keep the disease progression at bay. To address this issue, we designed a kidney health monitoring system that allows for affordable and quick testing through the use of inexpensive test strips and a mobile application. Moreover, the application serves as a research framework for testing and improving detection models for the disease. In this paper, we describe the application we developed and several preliminary machine learning models we trained to classify the severity of the kidney disease as normal, intermediate risk, or kidney failure. We thoroughly evaluated the effectiveness of our models and found that our histogram of colors-based boosted tree method outperformed alternatives and exhibited good overall prediction performance (F1-score > 90%).

T2  - 2018 Computing in Cardiology Conference (CinC)
AB  - Use of peak-picked ECG is generally not recommended for heart rate variability (HRV) calculations because the apparent R-wave peak moves around within the QRS due to the peak-picking operation. This study tests an algorithm for recovering high resolution RR intervals from peak-picked ECG. Two databases were used for testing, simulated ECG and Holter ECG from end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on and off hemodialysis. Twenty minute samples of single lead ECG (n=1000) were generated by the Physionet HRV ECG simulator. Each ECG record had a random combination of heart rate standard deviation and additive noise. 12-lead, 48 hour Holter ECG from 51 ESRD patients was split into 20 minute segments for HRV analysis. ECG was decimated to 250sps from 1000sps and then peak-picked to the final sample rate of 125sps. High resolution RR interval recovery was based on up-sampling and template matching to align beats. HRV standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN) was calculated for each 20 min. segment. Bland-Altman analysis was used to assess bias of SDNN error across the SDNN range. The bias of SDNN error at low SDNN values was pronounced for RR intervals defined by R-wave peaks. RR correction by template matching reduced (1) the impact of noise and (2) the SDNN error at low levels of SDNN.

AB  - Background: According to several recent research results [1]-[4], obesity can increase the risk of many diseases such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, metabolic disease, cardiovascular disease, etc. To prevent and treat the obesity efficiently and effectively, diet monitoring is an important factor. Purpose: Manual self-monitoring techniques for diet suffer from drawbacks such as low adherence, underreporting, and recall error [5]-[7]. Camera based applications that automatically extract type and quantity of food from an image of the food plate can potentially improve adherence and accuracy. However, state-of-the-art systems [8] have fairly low accuracy for identifying cooked food (only 63%) and are not fully automatic. To overcome these drawbacks such as low adherence, underreporting, recall error, low accuracy, and semi-automatedness, we introduce MT-Diet, a fully automated diet assessment system. It can identify cooked food with an accuracy of 88.93%. This is a significant improvement (over 20%) from the current state-of-the art system. Method: MT-Diet is a smartphone-based system that interfaces a thermal sensor with a smartphone. Using this system a user can take both thermal and visual images of her food plate with just one click. We used a database of 80 frozen meals which contain several different types of foods so that the actual total number of our food database 244 and the database has 33 different types of foods. By using the database, we demonstrate two core components: a) food segmentation, separating food items from the plate and recognizing multiple food items as a single food item, and b) food identification, determining the type of foods. Result: MT-Diet food segmentation methodology is fully automatic and requires no user input as opposed to recent works, the accuracy of separating food parts from the plate was 97.5%. The accuracy of food identification using Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function kernel based on color, texture, and histogram of oriented gradients features is 88.5%. Conclusion: We suggest a new and novel approach for diet assessment, MT-Diet. Our approach can potentially be an inexpensive, real time for the feedback on calorie intake, easy-to-use, privacy preservation, personalization based on eating habits of individuals, and fully automated diet monitoring system. The tool can also be used to conduct clinical studies to develop models of meal patterns that can be incorporated to design better artificial pancreas.

AB  - This work aims at studying the autonomic nervous system (ANS) response to hemodialysis (HD) treatment in a population of end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. ECG Holter recordings and whole body bioimpedance spectroscopy measurements were performed for each patient. Patients were classified according to the fluid overload (FO) values and the systolic blood pressure (SBP) measured before HD. Time domain and frequency domain indices from heart rate variability (HRV) signals were measured for the first 30 minutes and last 30 minutes of HD, the first hour after HD, and night (12.00 p.m.-4 a.m.). Significant differences were obtained in fluid overloaded but normotensive patients (Group IV) with respect to fluid overloaded and hypertensive patients (Group I) and normohydrated and normotensive patients (Group N+Dx). In particular, SDNN, RMSSD, SDSD, pNN50%, indices resulted significantly higher in Group IV with respect to the other groups. Overhydrated patients with hypertension (Group I) showed a blunted parasympathetic activity, which is supposed to contribute to hypertension.

T2  - 2016 IEEE 26th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)
AB  - A patient's estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) can provide important information about disease progression and kidney function. Traditionally, an eGFR time series is interpreted by a human expert labelling it as stable or unstable. While this approach works for individual patients, the time consuming nature of it precludes the quick evaluation of risk in large numbers of patients. However, automating this process poses significant challenges as eGFR measurements are usually recorded at irregular intervals and the series of measurements differs in length between patients. Here we present a two-tier system to automatically classify an eGFR trend. First, we model the time series using Gaussian process regression (GPR) to fill in `gaps' by resampling a fixed size vector of fifty time-dependent observations. Second, we classify the resampled eGFR time series using a K-NN/SVM classifier, and evaluate its performance via 5-fold cross validation. Using this approach we achieved an F-score of 0.90, compared to 0.96 for 5 human experts when scored amongst themselves.

AB  - The prevalence of end-stage renal disease in the U.S. Has grown significantly, and continues to do so. Organ transplantation generally has better overall patient outcomes than dialysis. But there is a significant shortage of kidneys. This shortage is exacerbated by the need for kidneys for patients with dual organ transplantations. So the kidney allocation problem is a significant challenge. Predictive analytics based clinical decision support systems need to be developed to help physicians make difficult organ allocation decisions. In this paper, we investigate two different classifiers to predict the outcomes of kidney-liver dual transplant patients. The models were evaluated on the basis of overall accuracy, root mean squared error and Area under ROC. UNOS data was used to develop the models.

AB  - Factors like the increase in the average age of the population, the malignant disease induced by bad habits, and the drug damage have led to the gradual increase of the incidence of chronic kidney disease worldwide. Most of them will develop end-stage renal disease, and eventually need renal replacement therapy. Hemodialysis is the most commonly used renal replacement therapy for end-stage renal disease patients. Autogenous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the main way to maintain hemodialysis. For a variety of reasons, AVF can be blocked. Once the blockage of the internal fistula is detected in time, early intervention can dredge the fistula vessels. If the blockage time is too long (> 24 hours), the probability of recanalization of the fistula will be greatly reduced. Therefore, early detection of internal fistula obstruction has important clinical significance. At present, angiography and ultrasonic technology are widely used in monitoring the flow of internal fistula. However, these methods may be invasive and require professional operation. Based on the characteristic of the sound stethoscope and the embedded Wi-Fi technology, combined with the electret pickup and its signal conditioning circuit, a portable wireless internal fistula murmurs acquisition system is designed in this study. The overall system size is 2.5cm*3cm*0.5cm, and the mass is less than 4 grams. The average power consumption of the system is less than 20mA and standby power consumption is less than 5mA. This system meets the requirements of wearable intelligent equipment. In order to effectively judge the obstruction of internal fistula, this study also proposed an algorithm for the characteristics of the time domain waveform of internal fistula murmurs, which can accurately diagnose the obstruction of internal fistula (accuracy:>95%).

AB  - COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus and increasing in cases every day. This is because the large number of patients makes it difficult to be treated at the hospital. This is behind the need for survival prediction of COVID-19 patients within 48 days so that the medical team can prioritize patients who are predicted to not survive on that period. In this research, the firefly algorithm is used which aims to select attributes and will perform comparisons for data that is balance or imbalance and combined with data that do feature selection and does not feature selection. The data that will be used are age, asthma, diabetes, gender, COPD, pregnancy, hypertension, obesity, ICU, chronic kidney disease, smoking, heart disease, immune deficiency, pneumonia, and other medical history. In this research, the selected attributes were gender, type of patient, intubation, pneumonia, age, pregnancy, diabetes, COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), asthma, hypertension, other diseases, obesity, chronic kidney disease, smokers, contact with COVID patients, and ICU. The prediction model with the highest level of performance is a model with balanced data with a recall value of 0.79, then a precision value of 0.93, then an f score of 0.85, then an accuracy value of 0.86, then a specificity 0,93, then a NPV 0,82 and a geometric mean value of 0.87

AB  - Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) has witnessed a rapid growth over the past decade, providing a variety of automated tools for the analysis of medical images. In surgical pathology, such tools enhance the diagnosing capabilities of pathologists by allowing them to review and diagnose a larger number of cases daily. Geared towards developing such tools, the main goal of this paper is to identify useful computer vision based feature descriptors for recognizing cancerous tissues in histopathologic images. To this end, we use images of Hematoxylin & Eosin-stained microscopic sections of breast and prostate carcinomas, and myometrial leiomyosarcomas, and provide an exhaustive evaluation of several state of the art feature representations for this task. Among the various image descriptors that we chose to compare, including representations based on convolutional neural networks, Fisher vectors, and sparse codes, we found that working with covariance based descriptors shows superior performance on all three types of cancer considered. While covariance descriptors are known to be effective for texture recognition, it is the first time that they are demonstrated to be useful for the proposed task and evaluated against deep learning models. Capitalizing on Region Covariance Descriptors (RCDs), we derive a powerful image descriptor for cancerous tissue recognition termed, Covariance Kernel Descriptor (CKD), which consistently outperformed all the considered image representations. Our experiments show that using CKD lead to 92.83%, 91.51%, and 98.10% classification accuracy for the recognition of breast carcinomas, prostate carcinomas, and myometrial leiomyosarcomas, respectively.

AB  - Diabetes is a disorder caused by an increase in blood glucose levels due to insulin secretion deficiency (type 1 diabetes) or impaired insulin activity (type 2 diabetes). More than 90% of people with this condition are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Diabetes is now the leading cause of blindness, end-stage renal failure, non-traumatic limb amputations, heart disease, and stroke. Due to the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes in recent years, the prognosis and early diagnosis of the disease have gained much importance. In this paper a study on the types of diabetes is made and a model is proposed and developed for diagnosis of type 2 diabetes using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) method.

AB  - This is paper proposes a knowledge construction system. The key objective of the system is to extract knowledge from structured data which is generally available in the form of electronic medical records (EMR). In this regard, the main focus of the research is to design and develop a domain-independent system that is capable of assisting the domain expert(s) in gaining non-trivial insights from the underlying EMR data. It is important to note that most of the research in the domain of cost-sensitive feature selection relies on black-box models which only provide a prediction of a final class label. Whereas, the goal of this research is to acquire insights for domain experts such as chronic kidney disease classification. This goal is achieved by designing and developing a knowledge construction system that is based on a two-stage methodology. Stage one deals with identifying salient cost-sensitive features in the EMR data, whereas, stage-two deals with consolidating knowledge (i.e. in the form of production rules) from a set of interpretable machine learning models. Finally, in order to demonstrate the efficacy of the system a chronic kidney disease case study is adopted.

AB  - Approximately 10-15% of the population worldwide is affected by Chronic Kidney Diseases (CKD). The most severe form of CKD is an end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and the treatment for ESRD is either by dialysis or kidney transplantation. Around 30% of patients with ESRD have a willing living donor in time of transplant, but their donors are incompatible due to either blood group incompatibility or human leucocyte antigen sensitization of the recipient against the donor. Kidney Exchange Program (KEP) is a policy that aims to solve this issue by matching incompatible pairs of donors and recipients with other incompatible pairs, thus increasing the chance of both pairs of receiving a kidney. Most existing research applied the exact method to solve the KEP models, but this method has some drawbacks. This research aims to propose a Genetic Algorithms (GA) approach in order to maximize the potential number of transplants in KEP. The proposed method counts and extracts all the cycles and chains prior to starting the algorithm. This step will significantly decrease the computing time needed to run the algorithm, which is one of the drawbacks of using GA. The result showed that solving the KEP by GA approach has the potential of achieving optimal results with 88.8% matching efficiency.

AU  - V. Chandola
T2  - 2017 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)
AB  - K-means algorithm has been a workhorse of unsupervised machine learning for many decades, primarily owing to its simplicity and efficiency. The algorithm requires availability of two key operations on the data, first, a distance metric to compare a pair of data objects, and second, a way to compute a representative (centroid) for a given set of data objects. These two requirements mean that k-means cannot be readily applied to time series data, in particular, to disease progression profiles often encountered in healthcare analysis. We present a k-means inspired approach to clustering disease progression data. The proposed method represents a cluster as a set of weights corresponding to a set of splines fitted to the time series data and uses the "goodness-of-fit" as a way to assign time series to clusters. We use the algorithm to group patients suffering from Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) based on their disease progression profiles. A qualitative analysis of the representative profiles for the learnt clusters reveals that this simple approach can be used to identify groups of patients with interesting clinical characteristics. Additionally, we show how the representative profiles can be combined with patient's observations to obtain an accurate patient specific profile that can be used for extrapolating into the future.

AB  - Water as one crucial element for the survival of human beings is necessary to be handled with care. With a 59% of the Sri Lankan population depending themselves on this indispensable element, the authorities and the people must heed the importance of safe consumption to avoid severe consequences like Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). In an attempt to address this social predicament, a smart device was fashioned as an initiative to predict safe consumption of groundwater and, to oblige and upskill the users to identify the quality of a groundwater sample in real-time. With the inclusion of machine learning techniques, the implementation was done by predicting the Water Quality Index (WQI) which is a single numeric index that mirrors the overall quality of any water sample, with an accuracy of 97.82%. In addition, two more serviceable functionalities to predict possibilities of CKD outbreak and forecasting water quality parameters were also implemented with accuracies of 76.99% and 92% respectively. The sole of this research relies on the hardware device that embeds a set of sensors which accompanies the individual functionalities. The readings and outputs will be displayed through the mobile application which is real-time and of high performance with a friendly user-interface.

In addition a clinical application like metacarpal index determination which is a sensitive index for detecting bone quality in chronic renal failure can also be obtained.

AB  - Mobile Health (mHealth) systems are a growing field that allows optimizing monitor several patients chronic diseases, enhancing response times concerning patients health conditions. Due to the architecture of this type of systems, the security is an important matter for protecting the patient information privacy. Based on the Official Mexican Standard guidelines NOM-024-SSA3-2010, this paper presents the development of a security layer over a mHealth system aimed toward patients with Chronic Kidney Disease in peritoneal dialysis therapy, which was developed in the National Laboratory on Advanced Informatics in collaboration with the Regional Hospital Zone No. 11 of the “Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social” (IMSS). The proposed security layer is designed to protect two system elements: 1) Patient information and 2) Server availability. To achieve this, a symmetric encryption algorithm, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), is implemented in the services offered by the system to preserve the confidentiality and integrity of patient information. On the other hand, a security test, reCAPTCHA, is added in the user authentication service of the system to conserve server availability avoiding overloads using bots. To verify the correct functioning of the proposed security layer, a set of unit and integration test was performed for each system service.

TI  - CKD: Cross-Task Knowledge Distillation for Text-to-Image Synthesis
AU  - M. Yuan
AU  - Y. Peng
T2  - IEEE Transactions on Multimedia
AB  - Text-to-image synthesis (T2IS) has drawn increasing interest recently, which can automatically generate images conditioned on text descriptions. It is a highly challenging task that learns a mapping from a semantic space of text description to a complex RGB pixel space of image. The main issues of T2IS lie in two aspects: semantic consistency and visual quality. The distributions between text descriptions and image contents are inconsistent since they belong to different modalities. So it is ambitious to generate images containing consistent semantic contents with the text descriptions, which is the semantic consistency issue. Moreover, due to the discrepancy of data distributions between real and synthetic images in huge pixel space, it is hard to approximate the real data distribution for synthesizing photo-realistic images, which is the visual quality issue. For addressing the above issues, we propose a cross-task knowledge distillation (CKD) approach to transfer knowledge from multiple image semantic understanding tasks into T2IS task. There is amount of knowledge in image semantic understanding tasks to translate image contents into semantic representation, which is advantageous to address the issues of semantic consistency and visual quality for T2IS. Moreover, we design a multi-stage knowledge distillation paradigm to decompose the distillation process into multiple stages. By this paradigm, it is effective to approximate the distributions of real image and understand textual information for T2IS, which can improve the visual quality and semantic consistency of synthetic images. Comprehensive experiments on widely-used datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed CKD approach.

AB  - In this work, a novel approach to erythropoietin dosing for anemia management in patients with chronic kidney disease is introduced. A weighted constrained quadratic programming problem is proposed to recursively estimate patient models providing better estimation results than standard system identification methods. The constrained optimization modeling method provides a stable autoregressive with exogenous inputs model that mimics parameter patterns learned from a more complex nonlinear physiologically based model.

AB  - Connected objects are the key for many intelligent systems for instance, direct access to physical and physiological values and collecting information about the human body. Our research works aim to develop non-invasive methods that predict risk for dialysis patient in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) at a smart home care system based on Internet of Things (IoT). However, the IoT components pose many new challenges in collecting more fine grained information called biomarkers. In this paper, we describe our work in progress to predict dialysis biomarkers from IoT sensors. To address this problem, we present our ongoing research to develop a modern data analytics environment using machine learning techniques. This paper gives also an overview about literature review and discusses open issues.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging has achieved an increasingly important role in the clinical work-up of renal diseases such chronic kidney disease (CKD). A large panel of parameters have been proposed to diagnose CKD among them total kidney volume (TKV) which recently qualified as biomarker. Volume estimation in renal MRI is based on image segmentation of the kidney and/or its compartments. Beyond volume estimation renal segmentation supports also the quantification of other MR based parameters such as perfusion or filtration. The aim of the present article is to discuss the recent existing literature on renal image segmentation techniques and show today's limitations of the proposed techniques that might hinder clinical translation. We also provide pointers to open source software related to renal image segmentation.

AB  - This paper analyzed the associations between COVID severity conditions and 7 comorbid diseases - Breast Cancer, Chronic Kidney Disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Coronary Artery Disease, Lung Cancer, Obesity, and Type 2 Diabetes. Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) results were used to obtain Single-nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) for each disease. QQ plots were then used to compare the distribution of p-values for the GWAS SNPs with a uniform distribution to allow for the filtering out of insignificant SNPs. A co-association algorithm, based off of a fixed position window, was then applied to the filtered GWAS data to identify the degree of influence each of the 7 diseases have on the 3 COVID severities. A haplotype- block-based algorithm was then applied to identify specific genes that drives observed comorbidity patterns. Results showed that Chronic Kidney Diseases or Obesity are better predictors for COVID Infection, but not good predictors for Severe or Hospitalized COVID. It was also found that TRPC7, EXOC6, RNGTT, XPO7, PEX19, EDC4 and 7 more genes display recurring patterns of coassociation with multiple comorbid disease and clear inclination towards specific severity conditions.

AB  - There are many people with chronic kidney disease in China, so manual segmentation can not meet the huge social needs. Due to the ability to accurately segment the images, deep learning methods can be used for the detection of kidney diseases. In this paper, a total of 881 renal ultrasound images were collected and labelled. Four semantic segmentation networks, including FCN, U-Net, SegNet and Deeplab were used to segment renal ultrasound images. In order to measure the segmentation effect of different networks, two common indicators, PA and IoU, were used to evaluate the results. The results showed that all the four semantic segmentation networks achieved good results in renal ultrasound image segmentation, among which Deeplab had the best effect on the test set, with PA reaching 99.14% and IoU reaching 0.8219.

AB  - Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is a vascular access and very import in hemodialysis that is a treatment for patients suffering from end-stage renal disease. Stenosis is considered the major cause of dysfunction of AVF. Despite the relatively low thrombosis rates of AVF, surveillance programs are necessary for detection of stenosis. However, conventional Doppler ultrasound cannot facilitate the risk assessment of AVF, such as insufficient resolution. The objective of this study was to develop an estimation system using FPGA based color relational analysis (CRA) method for AVF stenosis on hemodialysis patients by quantitative Doppler ultrasound, which provides not only the degrees of stenosis (DOS), but also anatomical locations and blood flow physiology information for clinical physicians, lowing the risk arising from treatment. In this paper we proposed a method based on hemodynamic analysis with dimensionless numbers to capture and further quantify the feature values of Doppler ultrasound extracted from intraluminal blood flow. The ratio of the supracritical Reynolds (Resupra) number and the resistive (Res) index were calculated via the peak-systolic and peak-diastolic velocities of blood flow from the arterial anastomosis sites (A) to the venous anastomosis sites (V) to quantitate the DOS at multiple measurement sites. After that, the results were mapped with a CRA classifier to real-time display the DOS. The examination results from thirty long-term dialysis patients showed that this proposed method performed well in DOS and occlusion site detection, with >95% of accuracy. This study confirmed the CRA method is a potential candidate method to effectively evaluate the AVF caused by long-term dialysis or vascular disease. The proposed system provides useful information with better accuracy and convenience for clinical examination.

AB  - Renal transplantation is the best treatment for end-stage renal disease. Transplanted patients need to take immunosuppressant drugs to keep long-term survival. However, the cost of immunosuppressant drugs is high in China, so it is necessary to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of immunosuppressant drugs to provide guidance for medical decision. Transition probabilities estimation is a key step in cost-effectiveness analysis. In order to obtain accurate estimations of transition probabilities from small sample, a Markov model and genetic algorithm based method is proposed in this paper. Then, this method is applied in a case study. The results of case study show that the effectiveness of cyclosporine and tacrolimus are comparable in the following five years after transplantation. Meanwhile, the results of the case study also show that Markov model and genetic algorithm based method is effective for cost effectiveness analysis and can be used in other cost-effectiveness analysis studies.

In this study, we use bolus tracking method to compute BFR from clinical images obtained using digital subtraction angiography and evaluate the quantification accuracy versus thermodilution (TD) flow measurement using four different bolus transit time algorithms. We found that the cross-correlation method had the best overall accuracy with mean quantification error of 27+/-13% while all other methods had error >44%. The calculated BFR was dependent on frame rate and acquisition duration and the highest computational accuracy (83-115% of TD flow) was obtained for images with complete bolus flow-in and wash-out phases. The results of this investigation will be useful for developing flow measurement tool and preparing custom acquisition protocol for angiography suite.

AB  - Kidney transplantation is typically the most effective treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease. However, the supply of kidneys is far short of the fast-growing demand. Kidney paired donation (KPD) programs provide an innovative approach for increasing the number of available kidneys. In a KPD program, willing but incompatible donor-candidate pairs may exchange donor organs to achieve mutual benefit. Recently, research on exchanges initiated by altruistic donors (ADs) has attracted great attention because the resultant organ exchange mechanisms offer advantages that increase the effectiveness of KPD programs. Currently, most KPD programs focus on rule-based strategies of prioritizing kidney donation. In this paper, we consider and compare two graph-based organ allocation algorithms to optimize an outcome-based strategy defined by the overall expected utility of kidney exchanges in a KPD program with both incompatible pairs and ADs. We develop an interactive software-based decision support system to model, monitor, and visualize a conceptual KPD program, which aims to assist clinicians in the evaluation of different kidney allocation strategies. Using this system, we demonstrate empirically that an outcome-based strategy for kidney exchanges leads to improvement in both the quantity and quality of kidney transplantation through comprehensive simulation experiments.

AB  - We propose a 6D pose estimation method for an object from a single RGB image for a robotic grasping task. Many approaches estimate pose parameters from images taken from other viewpoints and use deep learning to achieve high accuracy. However, most of these methods are not robust to changes in object texture, and there is a possibility that the correct pose cannot be estimated by only one-time inference. Our aims are to reduce the number of failure cases and improve the accuracy by a novel architecture using the iterative backpropagation of a pose decoder network and pose estimation on intermediate representation. The error between random and target pose parameters are backpropagated to a neural network and the gradient for approaching the target pose is obtained. The pose parameter is updated using the obtained gradient, the error is calculated again, and backpropagation is re-performed. Repeating this process, we estimate a more accurate pose. Experiments using our own dataset show that estimation accuracy is improved and the number of failure cases is reduced. Furthermore, estimation by coarse-to-fine iterative processing is more accurate and faster. We also experiment with grasping using a UR5 robot and show that the robot can grasp objects without depth information when using the pose estimated by the proposed method.

Traditionally, the health care domain relies on the centralized data, which may lead the system to have significant risks and difficulties. The proposed model involves uses federated learning, a machine learning technique that involves training an algorithm on multiple decentralized data. The model uses image processing technique, where the scanned image of the kidney is given as the input. The image, upon various pre-processing techniques identifies the affected area of the kidney. The affected area is also marked in color and the values of accuracy, efficiency, specificity and sensitivity are found to be higher than the existing systems. The output of the single image is again given to training dataset to increase the accuracy precisely, which is a part of the federated learning.

T2  - 2017 Computing in Cardiology (CinC)
AB  - Chronic kidney disease appears worldwide. In the United States, the number of patients suffering from kidney failure doubled from 1998 to 2010. A common treatment for these patients is haemodialysis. However, the frequency of deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases is up to 10% to 30% higher in patients undergoing dialysis than in the general population. To analyse the underlying effects and for a possible risk prediction, a continuous monitoring of the ionic concentrations that are influenced by dialysis is desired. In this work, a method for the reconstruction of the ionic concentrations of calcium and potassium from the ECG is proposed. In a first step, 91 monodomain simulations with the ten Tusscher ventricular cell model were performed for different extracellular ionic concentrations. From there, a standard 12-lead ECG was extracted. Calcium and potassium changes yielded ECGs clearly differing in amplitude and morphology. In a second step, the simulated ECG signals were used for reconstructing the ionic concentrations directly from the ECG. Features were extracted from the signals designed to describe changes caused by varied ionic concentrations. The inverse problem, i.e. coming back from the ECG features to the ionic concentrations was solved by regression with an artificial neural network. Results for potassium estimation yield an error of 0.00±0.28 mmol/l (mean±standard deviation) calculated with 7-fold cross validation. The estimation error for calcium was 0.00±0.08 mmol/l. Although these results underline the suitability of the method, the used ECGs differed from the observed in a clinical environment. However, simulations allow an evaluation under controlled conditions of a particular effect that was intended to be investigated. As the application to clinical data is yet missing, this study can be seen as a proof of concept showing that an artificial neural network is capable of exactly estimating potassium and calcium concentrations from ECG features.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease has become a worldwide public health problem which demands careful assessments by pathologists. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for fine-grained classification of glomerular lesions in renal pathology images sampling from patients with IgA nephropathy. The adversarial correlation loss is innovatively presented to guide a parallel convolutional neural network. In this well- designed loss function, bias between the prediction and the label was take into account while the relationship among different categories is well-aligned. Glomerular lesions in this study are divided into five subcategories, Neg (Negative samples such as tubule and artery), SS (sclerosis involving a portion of the glomerular tuft), GS (sclerosis involving 100% of the tuft), C (build-up of more than two layers of cells within Bowman's space, often with fibrin and collagen deposition) and NOA (none of above). Our model with 93.0% accuracy and 92.9% Fl-score for these five categories has proved superior to other models through experimental results.

AB  - Telemedicine is a mean of facilitating the distribution of human resources and professional competences. It can speed up diagnosis and therapeutic care delivery and allow peripheral healthcare providers to receive continuous assistance from specialized centers. The need of specialized human resources becomes critical with the aging of the population. The treatment of renal failure is an example where telemedicine can help to increase care quality. Over the last decades Bayesian networks has become a popular representation for encoding uncertain expert knowledge. Dynamic Bayesian networks are an extension of Bayesian networks for modeling dynamic processes. We developed a dynamic Bayesian network adapted to the monitoring of the dry weight of patients suffering from chronic renal failure treated by hemodialysis. An experimentation conducted at dialysis units indicated that the system is reliable and gets the approbation of its users

AB  - Forecasting tools that accurately predict post-transplantation healthcare use of older end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are needed at the time of transplantation in order to ensure smooth care delivery in the post-transplant period. We addressed this need by developing a machine-learning-based calculator that predicts the cost of healthcare for older recipients of a deceased-donor kidney over the first year following transplantation. Regression tree and regularized linear regression methods, including ridge regression, lasso regression and elastic net regression were explored on all cases of deceased-donor renal transplants performed for patients aged over 60 in Ontario, Canada between March 31, 2002 and April 31, 2013 (N=1328), The optimal model (lasso) identified age, membership of one of 14 regionalized Local Health Integration Networks, blood type, sensitization, having diabetes as the primary case of ESRD, total healthcare costs in the 12-month pre-workup period and the 6-month workup period to be inputs to the cost calculator. This cost calculator, in conjunction with clinical outcome information, will aid health system planning and performance to ensure better management of recipients of scarce kidneys.

AB  - The CHRONIOUS system defines a powerful and easy to use framework which has been designed to provide services to clinicians and their patients suffering from chronic diseases. The system is composed of a wearable shirt that integrate several body sensors, a portable smart device and a central sub-system that is responsible for the long term storage of the collected patient's data. A multi-parametric expert system is developed for the analysis of the collected data using intelligent algorithms and complex techniques. Apart for the vital signals, dietary habits, drug intake, activity data, environmental and biochemical parameters are recorded. The CHRONIOUS platform is validated through clinical trials in several medical centers and patient's home environments recruiting patients suffering from Chronic Obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) diseases. The clinical trials contribute in improving the system's accuracy, while Pulmonologists and Nephrologists experts utilized the CHRONIOUS platform to evaluate its efficiency and performance. The results of the utilization of the system were very encouraging. The CHRONIOUS system has been proven to be a well-validated real-time patient monitoring and supervision platform, providing a useful tool for the clinician and the patient that would contribute to the more effective management of chronic diseases.

AB  - The adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has made patient data increasingly accessible, precipitating the development of various clinical decision support systems and data-driven models to help physicians. However, missing data are common in EHR-derived datasets, which can introduce significant uncertainty, if not invalidating the use of a predictive model. Machine learning (ML)-based imputation methods have shown promise in various domains for the task of estimating values and reducing uncertainty to the point that a predictive model can be employed. We introduce Autopopulus, a novel framework that enables the design and evaluation of various autoencoder architectures for efficient imputation on large datasets. Autopopulus implements existing autoencoder methods as well as a new technique that outputs a range of estimated values (rather than point estimates), and demonstrates a workflow that helps users make an informed decision on an appropriate imputation method. To further illustrate Autopopulus’ utility, we use it to identify not only which imputation methods can most accurately impute on a large clinical dataset, but to also identify the imputation methods that enable downstream predictive models to achieve the best performance for prediction of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression.

AB  - Ion concentration polarization (ICP) phenomenon has been extensively researched for electro-desalination and purification applications because of its efficient capability of separating any charged species from brines. In this work, the ICP purifier, for the first time, was applied for a novel continuous peritoneal dialysate recycler. Most of charged hazardous substances were sufficiently removed by conventional ICP mechanisms. Moreover, slightly charged toxic molecule (creatinine) was mostly eliminated through nanoporous membrane, and uncharged toxic molecule (urea) was perfectly decomposed by electrochemical reactions. Based on the combined removal mechanisms confirmed in a micro/nanofluidic platform, a macro ICP purifier was finally demonstrated for practical applicability. We would expect significant advances in a quality of life for chronic kidney disease patients by this ICP purifier.

AB  - Non-invasive assessment of kidney function and structure remains of clinical importance in the diagnosis and prognosis of chronic kidney disease. This work aims to evaluate the role of textures extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging in renal dysfunction detection by differentiating healthy and chronic kidney disease patients. Textural descriptors are extracted from apparent diffusion coefficient, blood oxygenation level dependent images and T2 maps. Synthetic resampling technique is performed to account for imbalanced classes and increase the variety of sample domain. Principal component analysis projection is applied to eliminate irrelevant features and compact the dataset. The performance of linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression and Naïve Bayes classifiers in terms of discriminating healthy and affected kidney is evaluated. The results of this preliminary study support the fact that chronic kidney disease affects texture parameters significantly. Textures-based predictive models have shown promise in accurate and safe renal function evaluation (accuracy, sensitivity and AUC up to 98%, 98% and 1 respectively).

AB  - Chronic renal failure is an increasing problem world-wide. It is important to monitor renal function precisely to assess disease progression, the prognosis, and therapy-effects. Correct segmentation of kidney compartments from the DCE-MR images is needed to support automated functional analysis of kidney. In this work we compared three unsupervised data driven approaches to automatically segment the renal compartments: k-means clustering, wavelet based clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models. The algorithms were applied to 4 DCE-MRI data sets in human kidney. Data were acquired with different temporal and spatial resolution as well as at 1.5T and 3T. Obtained results were compared to manually segmented kidney compartments. On average, the renal cortex could be segmented at 88%, the medulla at 91%, and the pelvis at 98% accuracy. Comparison of the methods showed no significant differences in the segmentation accuracies (p >;0.5). In conclusion, unsupervised data driven segmentation could be seen as a reliable and automated approach to support the analysis of renal function.

AB  - This study proposes a phonoangiography (PCG) signal processing method to help non-invasively diagnose Arteriovenous Graft (AVG) stenosis in patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Pre-existing binary- classification studies for Degrees Of Stenosis (DOS) indicated that the presence of high frequency acoustic signals characterizes stenosis AVG, but the specific range they pointed out vary from each other, including 300Hz to 600Hz, 400Hz or more, 700Hz. In order to obtain the true relationship between the frequency characteristics of the acoustic signal and DOS of AVG, our team proposed a multi-position sequence feature (MPSF) extraction method, the judgement of DOS has also been expanded from binary-classification to multi-level classification. This method uses a physical model built by our team to simulate normal AVG and AVG with different DOS, we selected upstream 7cm and downstream 7cm of the stenosis section as two measurement positions to collect AVG acoustic signal. The components of the AVG acoustic signal below 200 Hz are filtered using singular spectrum analysis (SSA), and the remaining part is subjected to power spectrum estimation using the Welch method. The frequency spectrum energy obtained from the two measurement positions is combined into MPSF to be trained in the LSTM neural network, thereby realizing multi-level classification of different DOS. Tests on AVG physical models and clinical patient data sets show that, compared to previous studies, this method has the better effect on diagnosis of DOS.

AB  - Avoidable hospital readmission is problematic as it increases the burden on healthcare systems, leads to a shortage of hospital beds and impacts on the costs of healthcare. Various machine learning algorithms have been applied to predict patient readmissions. However, existing literature has only focused on individual features of health conditions without consideration of associations between features. This paper proposes discriminative pattern-based features as a technique to improve readmission prediction. First, discriminative patterns that occur disproportionately between two classes: readmission and non-readmission, were generated based on hospital electronic health records. Second, the patterns were fed as features into a classification model for readmission prediction. Then, we have evaluated these discriminative pattern-based features in three datasets: diabetes, chronic kidney disease and all diseases. Experiments with each dataset showed that the features of chronic disease cohorts have fewer differences between the readmission and the non-readmission classes than the all-diseases cohort. Our proposed pattern-based model improved the prediction performance in terms of AUC (Area Under the receiver operating characteristic curve) by about 12% compared with the baseline models for the all-disease cohort, however, it showed little improvement for either diabetes or chronic kidney disease datasets.

AB  - As a challenging sub-task of event argument extraction, implicit event argument extraction seeks to identify document-level arguments that play direct or implicit roles in a given event. Prior work mainly focuses on capturing direct relations between arguments and the event trigger; however, the lack of reasoning ability imposes limitations to the extraction of implicit arguments. In this work, we propose an Argument-argument Relation-enhanced Event Argument extraction (AREA) learning framework to tackle this issue through reasoning in event frame-level scope. The proposed method leverages related arguments of the expected one as clues, and utilizes such argument-argument dependencies to guide the reasoning process. To bridge the distribution gap between oracle knowledge used in the training phase and the imperfect related arguments in the test stage, we introduce a conventional knowledge distillation strategy to drive a final model that can work without extra inputs by mimicking the behaviour of a well-informed teacher model. In addition, considering that conventional knowledge distillation methods transfer knowledge individually, we integrate it with a novel relational knowledge distillation mechanism to explicitly capture the structural mutual argument-argument relation. Moreover, since the training process is not compatible with the real situation, a curriculum learning method is further introduced to make the training process smoother. Experimental results demonstrate that the learning framework obtains state-of-the-art performance on the RAMS and Wikievents datasets. Ablation study and further discussion also show it could handle long-range dependency and implicit argument problems effectively.

AB  - In Europe, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease lay at approximately 18.38% in 2016. A common treatment for patients in the end stage of this disease is haemodialysis. However, patients undergoing this therapy suffer from an increased risk of cardiac death. A hypothesis is that the cause is an inbalanced electrolyte concentration. To study the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon and fight the consequences, a continous non-invasive monitoring technique is desired. In this work, we investigated the possibility to reconstruct the extracellular concentrations of potassium and calcium from ECG signals. Therefore, we extracted 71 ECGs using the simulation results of a modified Himeno et al. ventricular cell model comprising variations of the extracellular ionic concentrations of potassium and calcium. The changes dependent on the different extracellular ionic concentrations were captured with five ECG features. These were used to train an artificial neural network for regression. The study was performed both for noise-free and noisy data. The estimation error for the reconstruction of the potassium concentrations was -0.01±0.14mmol/l (mean±standard deviation) in the noise-free case, -0.03±0.46mmol/l in the noisy case (30dB SNR). For calcium, the result was 0.01±0.11mmol/l in the noise-free case, 0.02±0.17mmol/l in the noisy case. For both ion types, the result was improved by augmenting the dataset. We therefore conclude that with the calculated features, we are able to reconstruct the extracellular ionic concentrations for both potassium and calcium with an acceptable precision. When analysing noisy signals, the accuracy of the estimation method is still sufficient but can be further improved by an augmentation of the dataset.

These data together with the description of patients' drug intake and dietary habits are analyzed by the CHRONIOUS intelligent module. The patient's history and his demographic data are processed along with the rest of the signals, concluding in the description of his recent health condition and the estimation of his severity status. As pilot studies for the development and the evaluation of the CHRONIOUS system, two of the most frequent chronic diseases have been selected: the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and the Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). The architecture of the CHRONIOUS platform as well as some of the initial results are presented in this paper.

AB  - Non-used clinical information has negative implications on healthcare quality. Clinicians pay priority attention to clinical information relevant to their specialties during routine clinical practices but may be insensitive or less concerned about information showing disease risks beyond their specialties, resulting in delayed and missed diagnoses or improper management. In this study, we introduced an electronic health record (EHR)-oriented knowledge graph system to efficiently utilize non-used information buried in EHRs. EHR data were transformed into a semantic patient-centralized information model under the ontology structure of a knowledge graph. The knowledge graph then creates an EHR data trajectory and performs reasoning through semantic rules to identify important clinical findings within EHR data. A graphical reasoning pathway illustrates the reasoning footage and explains the clinical significance for clinicians to better understand the neglected information. An application study was performed to evaluate unconsidered chronic kidney disease (CKD) reminding for non-nephrology clinicians to identify important neglected information. The study covered 71,679 patients in non-nephrology departments. The system identified 2,774 patients meeting CKD diagnosis criteria and 10,377 patients requiring high attention. A follow-up study of 5,439 patients showed that 82.1% of patients who met the diagnosis criteria and 61.4% of patients requiring high attention were confirmed to be CKD positive during follow-up research. The application demonstrated that the proposed approach is feasible and effective in clinical information utilization. Additionally, it's valuable as an explainable artificial intelligence to provide interpretable recommendations for specialist physicians to understand the importance of non-used data and make comprehensive decisions.

AB  - Hypertension is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). However, the risk factors that cause hypertension patients develop into CHD remain unclear. This paper aims to study traditional and nontraditional risk factors of CHD in hypertension population. Data were extracted from the regional medical big data system of Shenzhen, a big city of China. In this study, we included 3395 hypertension patients aged from 30 to 79 years old. Among them, 1153 CHD events occurred within 3 years after they were first followed-up. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate the risk factors quantitatively and predict 3-year risk of CHD events. The results showed that traditional general-population-based CHD risk factors such as age, body mass index, diabetes, hyperlipemia, and chronic kidney disease still remained predictive in hypertension patients. In addition, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of CHD was 1.54 (1.19 to 2.01) for emotional or mental disorders, and 1.69 (1.21 to 2.34) for sleep disorders. And the model showed a good discriminative performance with an AUC of 0.839. It offered a new insight for hypertension patients that keeping psychological health and maintaining a good sleep quality could be helpful in preventing CHD. Given the high risk for CHD in patients with hypertension, control of these risk factors may have a substantial preventive effect on CHD.

AB  - Hemodialysis is the most common treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease. For hemodialysis, consistently functional vascular access must be surgically created with an anastomosis of artery and vein, referred to as an arteriovenous fistula (AVF). However, AVF dysfunction may occur over time. Angiography and Doppler ultrasound are usually used to detect the flow or the diameter of the AVF. But they require well-trained operators and are expensive, and even angiography is invasive. In this study, a noninvasive approach based on stethoscope auscultation for monitoring AVF stenosis was proposed. Here, a wireless blood flow sound recorder was designed to record blood flow sounds wirelessly. In order to effectively extract the varying feature of blood flow sounds for AVF stenosis, the 2-D feature pattern built from S-transform was also proposed as the feature in the AVF stenosis detecting algorithm. Different from other frequency-related coefficients, the feature pattern can contain the information of blood flow sounds in time and frequency domains simultaneously. Preliminary findings showed that the proposed approach can provide high-quality estimation of AVF stenosis (positive predictive value = 87.84% and sensitivity = 89.24%).

AB  - This paper proposes a novel model-based control methodology for a computer-controlled hemodialysis system, designed to maintain the hemodynamic stability of end-stage renal failure patients undergoing fluid removal during hemodialysis. The first objective of this paper is to introduce a linear parameter varying system to model the hemodynamic response of patients during hemodialysis. Ultrafiltration rate (UFR) and dialysate sodium concentration (DSC) are imposed as the inputs, and the model computes the relative blood volume (RBV), percentage change in heart rate (ΔHR), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) during the course of hemodialysis. The model parameters were estimated based on data collected from 12 patients undergoing 4 profiled hemodialysis sessions. The modeling results demonstrated that the proposed model could be useful for estimating the individual patient's hemodynamic behavior during hemodialysis. Based on the model, the second objective is to implement a computer-controlled hemodialysis system for the regulation of RBV and HR during hemodialysis while maintaining SBP within stable range. The proposed controller is based on a model predictive control approach utilizing pre-defined constraints on the control inputs (UFR and DSC) as well as the output (SBP). The designed control system was experimentally verified on four patients. The results demonstrated that the proposed computer-controlled hemodialysis system regulated the RBV and HR of the patients according to individual reference profiles with an average mean square error of 0.24% and 2.6%, respectively, and thus can be potentially useful for ensuring the stability of patients undergoing hemodialysis by avoiding sudden changes in hemodynamic variables.

AB  - The success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in 3D medical image segmentation relies on massive fully annotated 3D volumes for training that are time-consuming and labor-intensive to acquire. In this paper, we propose to annotate a segmentation target with only seven points in 3D medical images, and design a two-stage weakly supervised learning framework PA-Seg. In the first stage, we employ geodesic distance transform to expand the seed points to provide more supervision signal. To further deal with unannotated image regions during training, we propose two contextual regularization strategies, i.e., multi-view Conditional Random Field (mCRF) loss and Variance Minimization (VM) loss, where the first one encourages pixels with similar features to have consistent labels, and the second one minimizes the intensity variance for the segmented foreground and background, respectively. In the second stage, we use predictions obtained by the model pre-trained in the first stage as pseudo labels. To overcome noises in the pseudo labels, we introduce a Self and Cross Monitoring (SCM) strategy, which combines self-training with Cross Knowledge Distillation (CKD) between a primary model and an auxiliary model that learn from soft labels generated by each other. Experiments on public datasets for Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) segmentation and Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) demonstrated that our model trained in the first stage outperformed existing state-of-the-art weakly supervised approaches by a large margin, and after using SCM for additional training, the model’s performance was close to its fully supervised counterpart on the BraTS dataset.

AB  - The ability to analyze and assimilate Electronic Medical Records (EMR) has great value to physicians, clinical researchers, and medical policy makers. Current EMR systems do not provide adequate support for fully exploiting the data. The growing size, complexity, and accessibility of EMRs demand a new set of tools for extracting knowledge of interest from the data. This paper presents an interactive visual mining solution for cohort study of EMRs. The basis of our design is multidimensional, visual aggregation of the EMRs. The resulting visualizations can help uncover hidden structures in the data, compare different patient groups, determine critical factors to a particular disease, and help direct further analyses. We introduce and demonstrate our design with case studies using EMRs of 14,567 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients.

AB  - Hemodialysis machines are essential in improving life quality of patients with chronic kidney disease and improving hospital outcome in case of acute kidney injury. Maintaining and regulating patient fluid balance is a crucial problem amongst other control problems. Although, the fluid balance control is solved in these machines, there is no documented evidence of solutions, which targets the fluid balance of the patient directly on systemic level. This paper describes a systemic control method with MIMO ANFIS control, where the main target is to provide strict control of peristaltic pumps while the control algorithm fulfills not only pump related requirement but also satisfies the highest fluid balance related expectations. During the research, the practical applicability was being kept in focus.

AB  - Induction motors, important elements into the industry, are susceptible to faults during its lifetime service; yet, they can keep working without affecting the process, but increasing the production costs as they consume more electrical current. Broken rotor bars (BRB) detection is an important topic due to the fact that this failure is silent and produces a power consumption increasing, vibration, or introduction of spurious frequencies in the electric line, among others. In this regard, a monitoring system that can efficiently diagnose the induction motor condition is highly required. In this work, a new methodology for one and two broken bars detection is presented. First, the compact kernel distribution (CKD) algorithm, a new high resolution time-frequency algorithm, is introduced for the detection of anomalies produced by the BRB failure in the startup current signal by considering that these signals describe changes on its dynamic characteristics due to the fault; then, the variance, a statistical feature, of the signal processed by CKD determines in automatic way the induction motor condition. The obtained results show a high overall efficiency for detecting broken rotor bars as well as healthy condition

AB  - Fluid removal during hemodialysis leads to relative hypovolemia that may cause hemodynamic instability in end-stage renal failure patients. To maintain the hemodynamic stability of patients, this paper proposes a linear parameter-varying (LPV) system based model predictive control (MPC) approach to regulate the hemodynamic variables during hemodialysis. The system uses ultrafiltration rate (UFR) as the control input and tracks the changes in relative blood volume (RBV) and percentage change in heart rate (ΔHR(%)) during hemodialysis while maintaining the UFR as well as the percentage change in systolic blood pressure (ΔSBP(%)) within certain bounds. MPC based approach is utilized to account for system variability and to explicitly handle the constraints on the control input as well as the system output. To model the hemodynamic variables, multiple LPV systems are introduced. The control algorithm tracks the changes in RBV and ΔHR to follow reference trajectories. The system parameters are updated at each control interval to get the best fitting into the parameterized model. The simulation results show that while keeping the control input as well as the output within a practically realizable bounds, the system is able to regulate RBV and ΔHR to pre-defined trajectories as well as maintaining ΔSBP within bounds by adjusting the UFR. Such systems can help to ensure the stability of patient undergoing hemodialysis by avoiding sudden change in hemodynamic variables.

AB  - Hypertension is called the silent killer because it has no symptoms and can cause serious trouble if left untreated for a long time. It has a major role for stroke, heart attacks, heart failure, aneurysms of the arteries, peripheral arterial diseases, chronic kidney disease etc. An intelligent and accurate diagnostic system is mandatory for better diagnosis and treatment of hypertension patients. This study develops a fuzzy expert system to diagnose the hypertension risk for different patients based on a set of symptoms and rules. Next we design a neuro fuzzy system for the same set of symptoms and rules using three different types of learning algorithms which are Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), Gradient Descent (GD) and Bayesian Resolution (BR) based learning functions. Then this paper presents a comparative study between fuzzy expert system (FES) and feed forward back propagation based neuro fuzzy system (NFS) for hypertension diagnosis. This paper also presents a comparison among the learning functions (LM, GD and BR) where Levenberg-Marquardt based learning function shows its efficiency over the others. Comparison between FES and NFS shows the effectiveness of using NFS over FES. Here, the input data set has been collected from 10 patients whose ages are between 20 and 40 years, both for male and female. The input parameters taken are age, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), and heart rate. The diagnosis process, linguistic variables and their values were modeled based on expert's knowledge and from existing database.

AB  - Feature selection is one of the important tasks in machine learning. Feature selection task deals with selecting a subset of feature from an original feature set. An important consideration in feature selection is the usefulness of a feature i.e. a set of feature which is selected is neither irrelevant nor redundant. Most of the existing algorithms in the domain of feature selection are designed to optimize the aforementioned objective. In our research we have addressed a third dimension of usefulness i.e. cost of the feature. Cost-effectives of a solution is most apt in cases where there is an asymmetric cost of data acquisition such as medical diagnosis applications. In this regard, our research deals with enhancing the existing feature selection techniques with a post-processing stage in which cost consideration is also accounted for. The resultant solution is optimized for both important as well as cost-effective features. We have used particle swarm optimization with post processing over chronic kidney disease dataset for generating a feature subset set which is both salient and cost-effective.

AB  - Knowledge distillation (KD), as an efficient and effective model compression technique, has received considerable attention in deep learning. The key to its success is about transferring knowledge from a large teacher network to a small student network. However, most existing KD methods consider only one type of knowledge learned from either instance features or relations via a specific distillation strategy, failing to explore the idea of transferring different types of knowledge with different distillation strategies. Moreover, the widely used offline distillation also suffers from a limited learning capacity due to the fixed large-to-small teacher–student architecture. In this article, we devise a collaborative KD via multiknowledge transfer (CKD-MKT) that prompts both self-learning and collaborative learning in a unified framework. Specifically, CKD-MKT utilizes a multiple knowledge transfer framework that assembles self and online distillation strategies to effectively: 1) fuse different kinds of knowledge, which allows multiple students to learn knowledge from both individual instances and instance relations, and 2) guide each other by learning from themselves using collaborative and self-learning. Experiments and ablation studies on six image datasets demonstrate that the proposed CKD-MKT significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods for KD.

AB  - In the domain of chronic disease monitoring, continuous time-series vital sign data (such as blood pressure) can be collected through low-cost wearable devices. Approximately 300 million people have chronic kidney disease globally. These patients undergo multiple haemodialysis sessions per week. In addition, patients are at risk of intra-dialytic hypotension, which leads to chronic heart disease and a high incidence of mortality. We propose Bayesian Hierarchical Gaussian Processes (HGPs) to model changes of systolic blood pressure (SBP) over time for continuously monitored patients. Furthermore, we use Bayesian HGPs to infer the hidden latent structure of the SBP time-series pattern/trajectory for each individual patient. To identify normal versus abnormal patterns, we further propose symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence of multivariate normal distributions to provide a metric to identify deviations from normal latent trajectories. We apply Bayesian HGPs to a dataset of patients undergoing haemodialysis monitoring, and demonstrate its superiority in identifying abnormal SBP patterns compared to alternative state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.

AB  - Many chronic diseases show evidence of correlations with sleep-wake behaviour, and there is an increasing interest in making use of such correlations for early warning systems. This research presents an approach towards early chronic disease detection by mining sleep-wake measurements using deep learning. Specifically, a Long-Short-Term-Memory network is applied on actigraph data enriched with clinical history of patients. Experiments and analysis are performed targeting detection at an early and advanced disease stage based on different clinical data features. The results show for disease detection an averaged accuracy of 0.62, 0.73, 0.81, 0.77 for hypertension, diabetes, sleep apnea and chronic kidney disease, respectively. Early detection performs with an averaged accuracy of 0.49 for sleep apnea and 0.56 for diabetes. Nevertheless, compared to existing work, our approach shows an improvement in performance and demonstrates that predicting chronic diseases from sleep-wake behavior is feasible, though further investigation will be needed for early prediction.

AB  - People affected by hazardous diseases arise in recent years. The growth of the fatal diseases is at an alarming rate. Initial detection can be helpful to get relieved from the disease. Thus the techniques for the early stage identification is much required. Existing classification algorithms employed tend to distinguish normal and disease affected people and the limitation involves no beforehand awareness about the occurrence of the disease. Outlier detection has vital application in the medical research domain for alarming the patients priorly. Exploring outliers from the medical domain gives useful and effective information to the domain experts. Hence, we propose an Apriori-rare based Associative Classification technique to predict unexpected issues in the medical domain, which is accomplished by the discovering the outliers. Healthcare datasets like Mammography mass data, Chronic kidney disease and Heart disease from UCI repository are considered for diagnosis and prognosis. The built classifier by the suggested method, enhances the accuracy and prediction rate of the diseases by detecting the presence of outliers. The outcomes are compared with a Classification Based on Association rules (CBA) algorithm in R Tool. The proposed Apriori rare base associative classification algorithm excels than the existing CBA algorithm by 15% more accurate.

This work is a pilot study to illustrate that the CKD and SPWVD have better time and frequency resolution than the STFT. It demonstrates that accurate methods of computing the time-frequency domain should be found for ECG signals. Only then should future work be done to design discriminatory features and classifiers for arrhythmias.<>

AB  - This article presents a method of adaptively adjusting the window length used in short-time Fourier analysis, related to our earlier work in which we developed a means of adaptively optimizing the performance of the cone kernel distribution (CKD). The optimal CKD cone length is, by definition, a measure of the interval over which the signal has constant or slowly changing frequency structure. The article shows that this length can also be used to compute a time-varying short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The resulting adaptive STFT shares many desirable properties with the adaptive CKD, such as the ability to adapt to transient as well as long-term signal components. The optimization requires O(N) operations per step, less than the fast Fourier transform (FFT) used in computing each time slice, making it competitive in complexity with nonadaptive time-frequency algorithms.

AB  - CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease) is among the most serious health issues worldwide. Among the causes of total global mortality, chronic kidney disease ranked 27th in the Global Burden of Disease Study. Millions of people die every year as a result of an inability to afford treatment for chronic kidney disease. A kidney disease can be slowed or stopped if it is diagnosed and treated early. In order to predict CKD, machine learning is effective. In this paper, dataset from UCI repository is used with 24 features like age, sugar, albumin etc. The AdaBoosting ensemble algorithm, as well as K-Fold Cross Validation technique, is used to predict CKD. The missing data in this dataset is filled in using the Mean Imputation technique. Next, the classification of data is carried out using KNN, Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest(RF), Naive Bayes(NB), Logistic Regression(LR) and its ensembles. The results were compared with KNN, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. Experimental results shown that AdaBoost-Random Forest ensemble is 99 % accurate for early detection of kidney illness.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the severe diseases in which kidney functions are lost gradually over months to years. Though, in the early stages of CKD little to no symptoms can be seen, but the symptoms become much more visible at the later stages of the disease and in that stage, the treatments are expensive for developing and underdeveloped countries. Again, Machine Learning (ML) models can effectively help medical professionals to predict the disease correctly in the earlier stage. Therefore, the objectives of this research are firstly, to develop an ensemble-based machine learning model to predict CKD efficiently; and secondly, to develop a predictive a nalytic system based on the proposed ensemble model. To attain these objectives, twelve ML algorithms were explored on the open-sources dataset. Then, the performance of these algorithms was analyzed to fed into the ensemble voting classifier to select the best set of algorithms. As such, seven ML algorithms were selected based on their accuracy and false negative error to be fed into the ensemble voting classifier to predict CKD efficiently. The experimental results showed that the proposed ensemble machine learning model could detect CKD with 99.17% accuracy and zero false negative error. Finally, a usable predictive analytic system was developed integrating the proposed ensemble-based ML models.

AB  - Due to rising chronic kidney disease (CKD) cases across the globe, it is required to be detected and diagnosed effectively. Machine learning-based models can be an effective tool for early and effective predictions. In this work, we apply machine, deep, and ensemble learning-based models to predict the cases of CKD and non-CKD. We have also applied the stacking and voting ensemble of SVM, RF, Adaboost, LDA, and MLP models to effectively and quickly predict the CKD and non-CKD cases. Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC are used to evaluate the models’ performance. Further, the Freidman ranking is also calculated to measure the effectiveness of the models. A comparative study concludes that ensemble learning-based models are the best-performing models.

AB  - All across the world, heart disease is regarded as a fatal disease. Heart disease is a condition that affects both men and women equally and may be a major cause of death around the world. Early diagnosis of this condition is critical for everyone in order to reduce mortality rates day by day. Chronic kidney disease dataset, from UCI machine learning library, having 1190 samples with 14 characteristics has been used for this study. To make this research more potent, both Machine learning (ML) and Deep learning (DL) techniques were used to detect the sickness early. The data was normalized by standard scaler for having a class varience issue. We then used three deep learning techniques namely Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) with two other general machine learning approaches such as Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM). To show a replication study, the overall experiments were done based on the three different random subsets. For the classification measurement, we also employ the ROC and the AUC curves. Several promising outcomes have been achieved. We calculated accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. CNN provided the best results, with an accuracy of 99.16%.

AB  - In recent years, people worldwide have been suffering from various types of kidney diseases indescribably, among which chronic kidney disease (CKD) has exacerbated the situation. Early diagnosis of CKD is the only way to hinder the advancement of kidney disease in its initial stage. However, presently doctors can use machine learning classifier algorithms to identify the disease earlier than any other existing method. Here, this research work presents a method by using eight different machine learning (ML) algorithms that can promptly detect the infection of CKD considering the health condition dataset information of the patient. A dataset is used of nearly two months of that period delivered by the hospital to identify the plausibility of chronic kidney disease. This research study has used the Extra Tree Classifier (EXT), AdaBoost (ADB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Decision Tree (DT), Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB) and Random Forest (RF) to obtain an optimum result of prediction. After pre-processing the data, this research work has applied the ML algorithms and compared their performances, and eventually, the precise outcome has been obtained. The performance is analyzed by using the F1-score, precision, accuracy, recall, and AUC score. According to the analysis results, K-Nearest Neighbors and Extra Tree Classifier have performed better than other algorithms for achieving an accuracy of 99% preceding the Gradient Boost, which stands at 98%.

AB  - The identification of chronic kidney disease in its early stage is crucial to diagnose it on time. This prediction will provide enough time for the doctor or expert for the treatment of the patient and also reduce the risk. The treatment cost also decreases if the chronic kidney disease is recognized in its initial phase. Many researchers develop a number of expert or intelligent systems which help a doctor in the determination of this deadly disease, and after that, experts can diagnose the same disease before it becomes worse. Hence, these systems are also called lifesavers. The primary intent of this review paper is to provide a comparative study between several systems used for the diagnosis of CKD. This study evaluates which medical expert system is better to opt for the detection of CKD. The comparison of systems is made by considering the accuracy, and a graphical representation of it is also provided, which makes it easy to understand.

AB  - In recent years, the incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been increasing year by year due to unreasonable diet and living habits. CKD is a great threat to human health because of its low awareness rate, high fatality rate and undetectable in the early stage. At present, early detection and early treatment are still the most effective means for the treatment of CKD. However, due to the long collection period, the problem of sparseness and imbalance characteristics of CKD follow-up data makes CKD prediction difficult. Therefore, a resampling method is proposed to preprocess the data and construct a CKD combined classification prediction model based on AUC. The experimental results show that this method can effectively improve the comprehensive ability of model classification. In addition, multivariate regression analysis of the risk factors for new CKD also found that insulin resistance index was also highly associated with new CKD.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease is a common complaint that mainly affects the elderly. This leads to a more dangerous stage in humans where the kidneys stop working within a few days. However, many people who complain about their habitual behavior can live a long life. But, does not work out for all. There is no early prognosis for detecting the early symptoms of chronic kidney failure. Chronic kidney disease can only be diagnosed when tests show high levels of the substance in the body's urine and blood, indicating that the kidneys are not functioning properly. Detecting the disease early can treat CKD, which may not lead to higher stages such as kidney failure and often death. There are too many possibilities of missing values while generating test results. Therefore, numerous missing values during medical testing are calculated by KNN imputation with machine learning algorithms.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a public health issue which is seen as a significant threat to human life due to abnormal functioning of kidney over a period of months or years which, if left untreated, may damage vital organs in the body leading to an increased rate in cardiovascular mortality which may result in sudden death if not early detected. Data mining techniques are employed in several clinical diagnoses for making intelligent diagnostics decisions that can be applied in disease prediction. The performances of these techniques are very promising in the management of different ailments to reduce the high numbers of people that die yearly due to inaccurate diagnosis of numerous disease conditions. This study evaluates the performance of a bagging ensemble technique on CKD dataset with an effective feature selection technique to yield a reliable and accurate predictive model capable of correctly classifying diseased from non-diseased patients. The study was investigated on a real patient dataset obtained from the UCI machine learning repository consisting of 400 instances with 24 conditional attributes and a decisional class. Radom forest algorithm was used as a measure to select the best subset of features for the predictive models. Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor, and Decision Tree algorithms serve as the base classifiers whose performance were aggregated using the bagging ensemble approach to improve base learners' performances. Results obtained from the study showed the effect of feature selection and ensemble technique in improving the accuracy of data mining classification algorithms. The model's optimal result is achieved using 7 best-selected features on the ensemble classifier with 100% accuracy of CKD diagnosis compared to 98.3% accuracy without feature selection. Hence, making the model suitable for efficient diagnosis of CKD.

AB  - The glomerular filtration rate determination is the principal method to determine a patient’s chronic kidney disease stage. Currently, there are two main methods for its determination: blood and urine tests and renogram techniques. This paper aims to investigate the performance of machine learning techniques in the automated classification of renal scintigraphy exams to assist in determining the stage of chronic renal disease. To do so, we used the Database of Dynamic Renal Scintigraphy, containing 107 exams of dynamic renal scintigraphy, in which there are patients at various stages of chronic kidney disease. The images were segmented and, afterward, generated the renogram curves used as input to the classifiers. SVM (Support Vector Machine), KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), Decision Trees, and Ensemble were used as classifiers. The method that showed the best results was the SVM using the original curves as input. However, all the methods generated satisfactory results.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) implies that the human kidneys are harmed and unable to blood filter in the manner which they should. The disease is designated “chronic” in light of the fact that harm to human kidneys happen gradually over a significant time. This harm can make wastes to build up in your body. Many techniques and models have been developed to diagnos the CKD in early-stage. Among all techniques, Machine Learning (ML) techniques play a significant role in the early forecasting of different kinds ailments. ML techniques have been used for achieving analytical results which is one of the instruments utilize in medical analysis and prediction. In this paper, we employ experiential analysis of ML techniques for classifying the kidney patient dataset as CKD or NOTCKD. Seven ML techniques together with NBTree, J48, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Multi-layer Perceptron, Naïve Bayes, and Composite Hypercube on Iterated Random Projection (CHIRP) are utilized and assessed using distinctive evaluation measures such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), relative absolute error (RAE), root relative squared error (RRSE), recall, precision, F-measure and accuracy.The experimental outcomes accomplished of MAE are 0.0419 for NB, 0.035 for LR, 0.265 for MLP, 0.0229 for J48, 0.015 for SVM, 0.0158 for NBTree and 0.0025 for CHIRP. Moreover, experimental results using accuracy revealed 95.75% for NB, 96.50% for LR, 97.25% for MLP, 97.75% for J48, 98.25% for SVM, 98.75% for NBTree, and 99.75% for CHIRP. The overall outcomes show that CHIRP performs well in terms of diminishing error rates and improving accuracy.

AB  - The high incidence and prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), often caused by late diagnoses, is a critical public health problem, especially in developing countries such as Brazil. CKD treatment therapies, such as dialysis and kidney transplantation, increase the morbidity and mortality rates, besides the public health costs. This study analyses the usage of machine learning techniques to assist in the early diagnosis of CKD in developing countries. Qualitative and quantitative comparative analyses are, respectively, conducted using a systematic literature review and an experiment with machine learning techniques, with the k-fold cross-validation method based on the Weka© software and a CKD dataset. These analyses enable a discussion on the suitability of machine learning techniques for screening for CKD risk, focusing on low-income and hard-to-reach settings of developing countries, due to the specific problems faced by them, e.g., inadequate primary health care. The study results show that the J48 decision tree is a suitable machine learning technique for such screening in developing countries, due to the easy interpretation of its classification results, with 95.00% accuracy, reaching a nearly perfect agreement with an experienced nephrologist`s opinion. Conversely, random forest, naive Bayes, support vector machine, multilayer perceptron, and k-nearest neighbor techniques, respectively, yield 93.33%, 88.33%, 76.66%, 75.00%, and 71.67% accuracy, presenting at least moderate agreement with the nephrologist, at the cost of a more difficult interpretation of the classification results.

AB  - In patients with end stage kidney disease (ESKD), renal replacement therapy assumes some functions of the diseased kidney and is required to sustain life. Hemodialysis (HD) is the primary modality for treatment of ESKD and includes treatments to filter the body's toxins from the blood three times per week. It has been shown that nonadherence with dialysis treatment regimens is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, even with missing one routine session of HD [1][2]. We aimed to utilize clinical and nonclinical data sources to develop predictive models (PMs) that identify patients with a high probability of not attending their HD treatments within the following week.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the gradual loss of kidney function over a time period. Which is morbidity cause of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Also chronic kidney diseases accelerating the cardiovascular mortality rate because of dangerous levels of fluid and waste could build up in the blood. Hence early detection of this disease is effective for other organ effected by this failure in body. This paper demonstrates the early prediction model of kidney diseases using adaptive neuro fuzzy logic system (ANFIS). This model diagnosis the stages of kidney diseases so the treatment can be provide according to disease condition. Mat lab based ANFIS CKD stage prediction model is presented with accuracy of 94 per cent in term of actual output to estimated output.

AB  - The incidence, prevalence, and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) conditions have evolved over time, especially in countries that have varied social determinants of health. In most countries, diabetics and hypertension are the main causes of CKDs. The global guidelines classify CKD as a condition that results in decreased kidney function over time, as indicated by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and markers of kidney damage. People with CKDs are likely to die at an early age. It is crucial for doctors to diagnose various conditions associated with CKD in an early stage because early detection may prevent or even reverse kidney damage. Early detection can provide better treatment and proper care to the patients. In many regional hospital/clinics, there is a shortage of nephrologists or general medical persons who diagnose the symptoms. This has resulted in patients waiting longer to get a diagnosis. Therefore, this research believes developing an intelligent system to classify a patient into classes of `CKD' or `Non-CKD' can help the doctors to deal with multiple patients and provide diagnosis faster. In time, organizations can implement the proposed machine learning framework in regional clinics that have lower medical expert retention, this can provide early diagnosis to patients in regional areas. Although, several researchers have tried to address the situation by developing intelligent systems using supervised machine learning methods, till date limited studies have used unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The primary aim of this research is to implement and compare the performance of various unsupervised algorithms and identify best possible combinations that can provide better accuracy and detection rate. This research has implemented five unsupervised algorithms, K-Means Clustering, DB-Scan, I-Forest, and Autoencoder. And integrating them with various feature selection methods. Integrating feature reduction methods with K-Means Clustering algorithm has achieved an overall accuracy of 99% in classifying the clinical data of CKD and Non-CKD.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease in short CKD is a worldwide health problem with high death rate and high morbidness, it can trigger other diseases too. CKD has no clear symptoms in its beginning phase, since patients fails to notice it earlier. Diagnosing the CKD in advance allows the patients to get the treatment on time to prevent the development of the disease. The data set was retrieved from UCI (University of California Irvine) machine learning repository. The data set which was obtained has a large number of missing values. Those missing values were filled using mean imputation method. After filling the missing values, two machine learning methodology such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Logistic Regression (LOG) has been compared. On analyzing the performance of the two model KNN gives the better accuracy than LOG. Hence, the KNN model is proposed to diagnoses the presence and absence of CKD. The model is trained with 26 attributes and 400 samples. After diagnosing the CKD, the model predicts the severity of the disease by using eGFR (Estimated Glomerular filtration rate) value. This attribute helps the model to predict the stages of CKD which helps the patients to receive treatment in the early stage.

AB  - In the age group ranging from 65 - 74 worldwide, it is estimated that one in five men, and one in four women, have Chronic Kidney Disorder (CKD). 10% of the population worldwide is affected by (CKD), and millions die each year due to lack of access to affordable treatment. A protein present in urine, persistent proteinuria is a key indicator for the presence of CKD. Early detection can help prevent progression of kidney disease to kidney failure. This detection and subsequent prevention can be achieved by applying Data Mining techniques on patient information to predict the occurrence of Chronic Kidney Disease.In this research paper, a Data Mining algorithm, Boruta analysis is performed to extrapolate the factors which can fortify the chances of a patient having CKD. This analysis covers statistic data along with historic and medical details. The dataset has been obtained from UCI source which contains data of 400 samples from the southern part of India with their ages ranging between 2-90 years. Making a decision concerning the seriousness of given factors, an estimate can be drawn with respect to the same. In Australia, treatment for all current and new cases of kidney failure through 2020 will cost an estimated $12 billion. Such an algorithm can help many individuals overall who may experience the ill effects of such affliction in their lifetime. Boruta Analysis, being freely available helps in medical diagnosis which can be otherwise expensive. It makes the diagnosis economical as well as faster for the patients.

AB  - Chronic Kidney disease is a severe lifelong condition caused either by renal disease or by impaired functions of the kidneys. In the present area of research, Kidney cancer is one of the deadliest and crucial importance for the survival of the patients ’ diagnosis and classification. Early diagnosis and proper therapy can stop or delay the development of this chronic disease into the final stage where dialysis or renal transplantation is the only way of saving the life of the patient. The development of automated tools to accurately identify subtypes of kidney cancer is, therefore, an urgent challenge in the recent past. In this paper, to examine the ability of various deep learning methods an Adaptive hybridized Deep Convolutional Neural Network (AHDCNN) has been proposed for the early detection of Kidney disease efficiently and effectively. Classification technology efficiency depends on the role of the data set. To enhance the accuracy of the classification system by reducing the feature dimension an algorithm model has been developed using CNN. These high-level properties help to build a supervised tissue classifier that discriminates between the two types of tissue. The experimental process on the Internet of medical things platform (IoMT)concludes, with the aid of predictive analytics, that advances in machine learning which provides a promising framework for the recognition of intelligent solutions to prove their predictive capability beyond the field of kidney disease.

AB  - The link between air pollution and chronic kidney disease has been broadly examined by researchers. However, the relationship between the two remains unclear. Establishing this link has been complicated in part by the fact that air quality varies considerably from place to place. Therefore, this study designed a deep learning model that analyzed the relationship between air pollution data and chronic kidney disease. The experiments utilized real hospital data in Taiwan. Furthermore, we verified that the methods could help hospital teams in Taiwan better understand the association of air pollution and chronic kidney disease and also proposed subsequent and effective medical improvement plans.

AB  - Efficiency of haemodialysis in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is determined by calculating adequacy. The adequacy of dialysis and its measurement have been debated over the past 20 years by authorities concerned about how much of this life-sustaining treatment is appropriate for patients with ESRD. Currently, the minimum dose of dialysis (Kt/V) is assessed by computerised calculation of urea kinetics. Although fairly standard, it is still an approximate method due to the various assumptions made in the development of the final parametric model. In this paper, a new algorithm approach is presented for determining Kt/V using generalised regression neural networks (GRNN) and this research has shown it to be very promising.

We performed a retrospective cohort study on patients with diverse Chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages, with the aim to investigate the power of metabolomic biomarker model for diagnosis and prediction of disease progression. We built an elastic-net model (ENM) which consists fifteen metabolomic biomarker and serum biomarkers. The model was sensitive in classifying patients into G1 to G4 CKD stages, provided an accuracy up to 0.93. This model was also capable of identifying patients with fast disease progression from those with good prognosis. The hazard ratio for time-to-progression between the two groups was 3.22 (95% CI, 2.34 - 4.87; $\mathrm{p}\lt 0.0001)$, after adjustment for age, sex and baseline CKD stage.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease is a serious lifelong condition that induced by either kidney pathology or reduced kidney functions. Early prediction and proper treatments can possibly stop, or slow the progression of this chronic disease to end-stage, where dialysis or kidney transplantation is the only way to save patient's life. In this study, we examine the ability of several machine-learning methods for early prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease. This matter has been studied widely; however, we are supporting our methodology by the use of predictive analytics, in which we examine the relationship in between data parameters as well as with the target class attribute. Predictive analytics enables us to introduce the optimal subset of parameters to feed machine learning to build a set of predictive models. This study starts with 24 parameters in addition to the class attribute, and ends up by 30 % of them as ideal sub set to predict Chronic Kidney Disease. A total of 4 machine learning based classifiers have been evaluated within a supervised learning setting, achieving highest performance outcomes of AUC 0.995, sensitivity 0.9897, and specificity 1. The experimental procedure concludes that advances in machine learning, with assist of predictive analytics, represent a promising setting by which to recognize intelligent solutions, which in turn prove the ability of predication in the kidney disease domain and beyond.

AB  - Data mining and machine learning play a vital role in health care and also medical information and detection, Now a day machine learning techniques use awareness of some major health risks such as diabetic prediction, brain tumor detection, covid 19 detections, and many more. The kidney is the most important organ of our body and if it has any problem then the impact is more dangerous to our body. Chronic kidney disease (CKD), otherwise referred to as renal disease. CKD requires disorders that damage and reduce the capacity of our kidneys to keep us healthy. So, it is required to be concerned about kidney disease to our very primary stage. We take a few attributes to measure our analysis about chronic kidney disease and this attribute is one of the major occurrences of chronic kidney disease. Therefore 8 machine learning classifier are used to measure analysis using weka tools namely: Logistic Regression (LG), Naive Bayes (NB), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost), Bagging, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) classifier are used. We feature extraction of all attributes using principal component analysis (PCA).

The discovery of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) over 30 years ago has shifted the treatment of anemia for patients on dialysis from blood transfusions to rHuEPO therapy. Many anemia management protocols (AMPs) used by clinicians comprise a set of experience-based rules for weekly-to-monthly titration of rHuEPO doses based on hemoglobin (Hb) measurements. In order to facilitate the design of an AMP using model-based feedback control theory, we present a physiologically relevant erythropoiesis model and demonstrate its applicability using clinical data.

The proposed system model is tested using a dataset of 400 patients. To annotate the CT/Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan images, the edge detection technique is used in this paper. The system model is proposed considering four units such as edge detection, prediction, virtual assistant and book reader. Edge detection is an image processing technique that is used to identify points or edges in a digital image which are scanned images of CT/MRI. K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm is used in this model for disease prediction. Further, virtual assistant and book reader is used to assist the doctor. The proposed model in this paper may be useful for doctor as well as patients for CKD detection. The Machine Learning (ML) approach proposed in this paper may save time and costs for diagnostic screening.

AB  - Chronic renal disease is a common problem faced by people. Renal transplantation is the only treatment of choice for patients with end-stage renal disease. Prediction of a graft transplant outcome and the survival analysis with a high accuracy level is a challenging as well as very demanding task. The solution for this challenge lies in data mining and machine learning. An intuitive understanding of the post transplantation interaction mechanisms involving graft and host is intricate and on account of this prognosis of planned organ transplantation outcomes is an involved problem. Prediction methods based on donor and recipient data are indespensible for improved prognosis of graft outcomes. In our study a new method is developed to make the prediction process more efficient with improved donor recipient matching. Clinical information was gathered prospectively for 221 patients who underwent kidney transplantation. In this study we used two levels of classification: clinical and non clinical features separately implemented in SVM. The Cox regression analysis was done to find the most critical determent features.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) has infected almost 800 million people around the world. Around 1.7 million people die each year because of it. Detecting CKD in the initial stage is essential for saving millions of lives. Many researchers have applied distinct Machine Learning (ML) methods to detect CKD at an early stage, but detailed studies are still missing. We present a structured and thorough method for dealing with the complexities of medical data with optimal performance. Besides, this study will assist researchers in producing clear ideas on the medical data preparation pipeline. In this paper, we applied KNN Imputation to impute missing values, Local Outlier Factor to remove outliers, SMOTE to handle data imbalance, K-stratified K-fold Cross-validation to validate the ML models, and a novel hybrid feature selection method to remove redundant features. Applied algorithms in this study are Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour, Gradient Boosting, Adaptive Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting. Finally, the Random Forest can detect CKD with 100% accuracy without any data leakage.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease is a major health problem that affect the lives of millions of people around the world and causes serious economical, social and medical problems. Chronic kidney disease can be detected with several automatic diagnosis systems. In this study, we apply Adaboost, Bagging and Random Subspaces ensemble learning algorithms for the diagnosis of chronic kidney diseases. Decision tree based classifiers are used in the decision stage. The classification performances are evaluated with kappa and accuracy criteria. Considering the performance analyses of the proposed systems, it is observed that ensemble learning classifiers provide better classification performance than individual classifiers.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a chronic renal problem that affects the human kidney and makes it not to function properly or causes complete renal failure. It results in dialysis or causes other related diseases and reduces the quality of living. The symptoms of this disease cannot be identified in the preliminary stage. Only very lesser people are aware of this disease and can predict the symptoms at the earlier stage. However, it leads to prolonged disruption of kidney functional and finally causes it to failure and reduces the functionality completely. This can be occurred due to prolonged diabetes and also related with other diseases like Cardio-Vascular Disease (CVD). Due to the lack of awareness and inadequate prediction approaches in the preliminary stage, there is a delay in treating the patients" at the initial phase of disease. From the various literature studies, it is identified that CKD can be predicted and treated in the earlier stage using the soft-computational techniques. Earlier CKD predictor model needs to be improved with higher prediction accuracy and precision. Therefore, there is a need for a decision support system that assists the nephrologists during the time of emergency conditions. Therefore, in this research, Naive Bayes classifier is used for classification along with the Choice based Hierarchy (NB-CbH). NB classifier works effectually with huge dataset and reduces the computational complexity. The prediction rate and the severity of the disease analysis with NB are extremely higher.

AB  - Chronic Kidney disease (Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)) is a type of kidney disease where gradual loss of kidney function occurs over a period of months to years. But, when CKD cannot identify a manner or causation of the disease or set of causes it is known as Chronic Kidney disease with unknown etiology (CKDu). There are several factors to be considered when analyzing the main causes for CKDu such as socio-economic, environmental, meteorological and health aspects in relation to the CKDu in Sri Lanka. In this research work, identification of CKDu has been done using the relationship of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL) score, ankle swelling with the serum creatinine level of blood and considering risk factors. This research has been done using three major branches of Artificial Intelligence namely neural networks, convolutional neural networks and machine learning. The relationship between the mentioned factors and CKDu has been identified. The sensitivity of 77.27% and a specificity of 89.28% have been marked for the detection of CKDu related to ankle swellin.

AB  - Sri Lanka has been witnessing an increase in kidney disease issues for a while. Elderly kidney patients, kidney transplant patients who passed the risk level after the surgery are not treated in the emergency clinic. These patients are handed over to their families to take care of them. In any case, it is impossible to tackle a portion of the issues that emerge regarding the patient at home. It is hoped to enter patient’s data from home every day and to develop a system that can use that entered data to predict whether a patient is in an essential circumstance or not. Additionally, individuals in high-hazard regions cannot know whether they are in danger of creating kidney disappointments or not and individuals in danger of creating kidney sickness because of Diabetes Mellitus. Thus, we desire to emphasize the framework to improve answers for this issue. The research focuses on developing a system that includes early kidney disease prediction models involving machine learning classification algorithms by considering the relevant variables. In predictive analysis, six machine learning methods are used: Support Vector Machine (SVM with kernels), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Multilayer Perceptron. These classification algorithms' performance is evaluated using statistical measures such as sensitivity (recall), precision, accuracy, and F-score. In categorizing, accuracy determines which examples are accurate. The experimental results reveal that Support Vector Machine outperforms other classification algorithms in terms of accuracy.

AB  - In order to explore the ancient terms of chronic renal failure, we collected the ancient terms of chronic renal failure from modern literature retrieval, prominent TCM doctors' experience and monographs and textbooks and then designed a questionnaire based on the candidate ancient terms to conduct an expert consultation among experts of academic and medicine community in nephropathy department in tertiary general hospitals of Chinese medicine around China. A total of thirty-three ancient terms related to chronic renal failure were derived. And only twenty-five ancient terms were selected in the consultation questionnaire after standardization. Forty experts were invited in our study and thirty-seven experts (response rate of 92.5%) completed the questionnaire. They are come from 19 out of 34 provinces in China. After calculation, the top six ancient terms with highest consistency according to average score were "Ni Du", "Shui Zhong", "Guan Ge", "Xu Lao", "Shen Lao", "Long Bi". The results were consistent with the frequencies in modern literature retrieval, prominent TCM doctors' experience, and monographs and textbooks. In conclusion, "Ni Du", "Guan Ge", "Shui Zhong", "Xu Lao", "Shen Lao", "Long Bi" could be recommended as the ancient terms of CRF in the further study of ancient literature mining.

AB  - In the present days the Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a common problem to the public. CKD is generally considered as kidney damage and is usually measured with the GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate). Several researchers from health care and academicians are working on the CKD problem to have an efficient model to predict and classify the CKD patient in the initial stage of CKD, so that the necessary treatment can be provided to prevent or cure CKD. In this work classification models have been built with different classification algorithms, Wrappersubset attribute evaluator and bestfirst search method to predict and classify the CKD and non CKD patients. These models have applied on recently collected CKD dataset downloaded from the UCI repository. The models have shown better performance in classifying CKD and non CKD cases. Results of different models are compared. From the comparison it has been observed that classifiers performed better on reduced dataset than the original dataset.

AB  - Those who are with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) are not aware that the medical tests they take for other purposes sometimes contain useful information about the CKD disease, this information is not used effectively to tackle the identification of the disease. Thus, attributes of different medical test were investigated to identify what attributes contain useful information about the CKD. A database with several attributes of those who have CKD and healthy subjects were analyzed with different techniques, and their overall cost was analyzed. C4.5, One Rule, Naïve Bayes, and random forest methods were used to identify the important attributes. These analyses reinforce that serum creatinine, hemoglobin, Diabetes Mellitus, and hypertension are the most important attributes in identifying the CKD with the RMSE of 0.063 and with the lowest cost of $34.05.

AB  - Accurate assessment of renal microstructure and function remains a key point for the prediction and diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Applications of novel medical imaging techniques offer a non-invasive and safer tool for analyzing CKD as it allows health care providers to identify morphological, functional and molecular information that detects changes in renal tissue properties and functionalities. Recently, the ability of artificial intelligence to address information retrieval and other critical issues in big medical data analytics has led to a great interest in CKD diagnosis. Besides qualitative analysis of renal medical imaging, texture analysis combined with machine learning has emerged as a promising technique to quantify renal tissue heterogeneity, thus providing a complementary tool for renal function decline prediction. Most importantly, deep learning holds the potential to be a novel approach for renal dysfunction monitoring. This paper proposes a survey focusing on the most recent approaches for using texture analysis and machine learning techniques that can be integrated in clinical research in order to improve renal dysfunction diagnosis and prognosis.

AB  - Chronic Renal Failure (CRF) is a gradual loss of kidney's function over a period of time, ranging from months to years. Unlike other chronic diseases, CRF is not yet thoroughly explored in literature. In this paper, we propose a new clinical decision support system for diagnosing patients with CRF. Several data classification algorithms including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Naïve Bayes and Decision Tree are developed and implemented to diagnose patients with CRF and determine the progression stage of the disease. A clinical dataset of 102 instances is collected from patients' records and used in this study. Performance of the developed CRF diagnosis system is assessed in terms of diagnosis accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity and is evaluated by specialist physicians. Furthermore, the open source Weka software is also used in this study for performance comparison and evaluation purposes. The obtained results showed that the developed decision tree algorithm is the most accurate CRF classifier (92.2%) when compared to all other algorithms/implementations involved in this study.

Obesity and weight increment are two attributes that affect working on the personal satisfaction across the world. The Internet of Things (IoT), which interconnects, distinguishes, recognizes, and processes information between gadgets or administrations, assumes a basic part in accomplishing the common objective. The Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare gives us the ability to track, analyses, diagnose, and manage various overweight and obesity diseases. Also, provide weight-loss and obesity prevention solutions. Because there are a limited number of items that may be employed in IoT, another technology, such as machine learning, is being presented to achieve the above-mentioned benefits. People who are at high risk for cardiovascular illness may also be at risk for renal disease, which can be diagnosed and treated using medical information from the past. However, CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease) is a condition that has no analytic signs and is challenging to find, distinguish, and forestall, and it can forever hurt the wellbeing framework, along these lines AI is being utilized to track down it monastery for therapy forecast and examination. The principal objective of this examination is to foster a prescient model for CKD and coronary illness information utilizing open source Python modules. Machine learning algorithms can be used for prediction, and exactness is determined by comparing various algorithms including such K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) as well as Fast-Recurrent Neural Networks (FRNN). This method is used to forecast a dataset derived from a patient's medical history. The expected number lets us know whether an individual will foster persistent kidney illness or simply not in view of the amount of potassium in their blood.

Different machine learning and statistic algorithms for the models were proposed in studies corresponding to different medical datasets including a quantity of missing values for optimal outcomes. We approached this issue by applying stepwise logistic regression, ANN, and SVM algorithms to an ESRD dataset after case deletion and calculated areas under ROC curves of three algorithms as comparisons, resulting in 0.757, 0.664 and 0.704, respectively. The random hot deck, oversampling, and bootstrap methods were employed in data preprocessing to compensate the minor mortality. Afterward, average AUC of three algorithms approximated 0.90 (p<;0.02, unpaired t-test). As a result, the mentioned strategies dealing with bias medical data may ameliorate prognostic ESRD models in clinic.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease is a universal common obstacle which its outcomes can be prevented or delayed by early detection and cure. Classification of kidney disease is vital for global improvement and accomplishment of practical guidance. Therefore, data mining and machine learning techniques can be used to discover knowledge and identify patterns for classification. Since there exist features that make noise or have low information, feature selection issue identifies useful subset of features from raw data. The fact that dimensionality reduction improves computation performance creates fast and low-cost classifiers and produces quick classified models, makes it popular in data mining and machine learning techniques. In this article, we use a set of filter and wrapper methods followed by machine learning techniques to classify chronic kidney disease. We show that feature selection techniques enable us to perform precise classification in minimum time using fewer dimensions.

This study aims to investigate exhaled breath of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients during Hemodialysis (HD). To reach this aim, an electronic nose (e-nose), based on six SnO2 sensors, coupled with principal components Analysis (PCA), Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), as alternative tools for the resolution of complex classification situations, were used. As results, the application of PCA, DFA and SVMs methods revealed a good separation between clusters of the breath samples of healthy subjects and CKD patients before, during and after HD. Consequently, the data treatment by DFA have demonstrated its efficiency to discriminate between CKD at pre-HD and post-HD. These findings indicate that the proposed e-nose could be a noninvasive diagnosis tool of breath analysis for real time monitoring of HD treatment.

AB  - In renal medicine, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) based method is a standard for the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease. However, this method is invasive, uncomfortable, costly, and could be dangerous because it requires to draw blood from the artery vessels. Researchers have developed several non-invasive Doppler-derived measures based chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage diagnosing or prognosing approaches; however, there is no adequate automatic renal artery Doppler-derived CKD stage classification method in the literature. Thus, we propose a non-invasive, safer, faster, and low cost, SVM-based CKD stage classification method from a sonogram of the renal artery blood flow. The proposed method extracts kurtosis and curvature parameters of the probability distribution that generated from renal artery blood flow waveform. Kurtosis and curvatures are employed to measure the tailedness and curvedness of the probability distribution. We collected a total of 528 sonograms from 110 (49 males) CKD patients during 2010-2013. The experimental results revealed a statistically significant correlation between the parameters and CKD progress stages. Post-voting results revealed the best f1score of 0.956 for Positive (stages 1-5) CKD stages.

AB  - A kidney's major purpose is to eliminate waste materials and excess fluids from the body through urine, which helps to maintain a stable chemical equilibrium in the body. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a serious global concern that is defined by a steady decline of kidney function over time. CKD affects over 14% of the world's population and is difficult to identify in its early stages. This disease is usually detected at the final or most critical stage in the human body, posing a significant risk to the human body and often resulting in the person's death. If the condition is identified early on, the patient's kidney function may be saved, allowing him or her to live a longer life. Machine learning has progressed to the point that we can now examine the medical records of individuals and detect chronic kidney disease in its early stages. On the CKD dataset from the UCI machine learning repository, this research examines the occurrence of CKD by creating ML models with 6 distinct classification algorithms. Before we can use machine learning techniques on the raw dataset, we must first process it and remove any duplicated or null variables before sending it to the models. After running the data through all of the models, it was observed that Random Forest and Extra Trees Classifier proved the highest accuracy of 98.33. The literature survey conducted before execution offered valuable insights and helped to shorten the execution time because we only chose algorithms with good accuracy.

AB  - The healthcare industry collects huge amounts of healthcare data which, unfortunately, are not "mined" to discover hidden information for effective decision making. Data mining has been a current trend for attaining diagnostic results. Huge amount of unmined data is collected by the healthcare industry in order to discover hidden information for effective diagnosis and decision making. Data mining is the process of extracting hidden information from massive dataset, categorizing valid and unique patterns in data. Researchers all over the world are working in either multi agents or in ontologies for developing system in health care domain. It might have happened so many times that you or someone need doctor help but they are not available due to some reason. The health management system is an end user support and online consultation project. Here we propose a system that allows users to get guidance on their health issues through an intelligent health care online system. The objective of our paper is to predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), Heart Disease and Liver Disease using clustering technique, K-means algorithm.

AB  - Salt restriction, the method which was acknowledged by modern medical knowledge that could delay kidney disease progression, was advanced in ancient times. We found that salt restriction therapies were presented in many ancient literatures during our ancient literature mining work. We sorted out the ancient trace of salt restriction about edema in chronic kidney disease (CKD). From frequency of herbals, formula ontology and changes from a basic formula based on automatic extraction of semantic inference realized by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) knowledge graph, we explored the formula changed pattern accompanied with symptoms in CKD related edema from the view of salt restriction.

AB  - In this paper, we aim to explore the feasibility of salivary analysis for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) detection and thereby design an automated mechanism to detect CKD through analysis of human saliva samples. We have implemented an improved deep learning model that combines both a one-dimensional Correlational Neural Network (1-D CorrNN) and bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for making accurate predictions. The LSTM network is integrated with the neural model to utilize the capabilities of both these networks to analyze the time-series data. The proposed model is trained and tested with a CKD sensing module. The application of deep learning algorithms helps to improve the detection accuracy as they are capable of discovering the best features from the input data. The proposed method achieved an average accuracy rate of 98.08% for the testing dataset. The results show that the proposed detection module and classification algorithm substantially advance the current methodologies, and provides more accurate predictions compared to conventional methods.

AB  - chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the diseases with high mortality rate. It is a disease resulted from kidney function loss over a long period of time. The disease shows no symptoms during initial stage. When left not medicated, a person may suffer from other complications such as high blood pressure, anemia, malnutrition, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment and impaired physical function. Automated diagnosis by using classification algorithms has been an interest of researchers. In this study, six machine learning algorithms were used for classification and its prediction performance was compared based on training time and F1 score, with and without hypertuning the parameters. Of all the six algorithms, KNN has the best F1 score of 0.992248 and minimal training time of 46.999ms. The performance of decision trees was improved with hypertuning, having a F1 score from 0.96 to 0.99. Overall, machine learning algorithms are significant tool to assess chronic kidney disease.

AB  - Renal failure due to diabetic nephropathy is the main cause of death in patients with insulin dependent diabetes and on average death occurs seven years after the start of persistent albuminuria. Increased arterial blood pressure is an early and common occurrence in diabetic nephropathy. Antihypertensive treatment reduces albuminuria and diminishes the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate thereby postponing end stage renal failure in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Enalapril is considered for use as a renal protective drug in normotensive diabetics with persistent microalbuminuria. In a short term experimental study, Enalapril has been shown to reduce the albumin exertion rate in adolescent diabetic patients with or without elevated blood pressure and its antiproteinuric effect independent of its effect on systemic blood pressure. Since these tests are quite expensive and time taking, we have formulated this problem in the framework of an artificial neural network (ANN) to measure the long term efficacy of Enalapril. Based upon the data available from testing of patients, the proposed ANN has been trained using a backpropagation (BP) algorithm. The network is used for the long term efficacy of Enalapril phantomly. The proposed network gives encouraging results.

AB  - The data from Ministry of Health Indonesia in the report infoDATIN 2017 mention that the Chronic kidney disease was the 27th leading cause of death globally then upward to 18th in 2010. In the report also states that chronic kidney disease prevalence increases with the rising in elderly population and also the increased cases of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The difficulty of early detection is one reason for the study of the disease. The C4.5 algorithm is used to obtain a model for detecting chronic kidney disease. The classification model was built using 400 patient data as a dataset and 24 attributes in the form of symptoms suffered by patients. The C4.5 algorithm generates the decision tree so that it is simple to implement the classification model formed into the software with the ways a decision tree translated into classification rules. This algorithm was chosen because some other research in the same study case also shows the results that the C4.5 algorithm has an accuracy rate above 5O%. The results of the model testing produced by the C4.5 algorithm show the accuracy rate is 97.50% and a precision rate is 97.33% with a ROC curve (AUC) of 0.978. Thus, the software was built using the C4.5 classification model for diagnose Chronic kidney disease diagnosis has an excellent classification category.

AB  - This paper introduces the idea of detecting the presence of kidney disease through machine learning based classification modelling, by processing the patient's ECG signal. Recent studies and ongoing researches have showed that patients undergoing kidney problems start developing cardiac problems- scientifically known as the Cardio Renal Syndrome (CRS) which can lead to a sudden cardiac arrest in the last stages of their disease. Since cardio-vascular diseases and the chronic kidney disease is inter-related, this model can be used for patients undergoing cardio-vascular problems to determine whether their kidneys have been effected or not. If the Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) can be diagnosed at an earlier stage, it may give the patient some time to help reverse the disease or at least slow its progression by taking necessary medical steps. For this model, digitized ECG data was collected from open access databases such as PTB (for kidney patients) and Fantasia (for healthy people) from Physionet Database (www.physionet.org) and the model was later validated using different data from the same online database. The validation process gave satisfactory results, as the model could successfully classify the users from being healthy or a kidney patient. In our study, we found an accuracy level of 97.6% which was the highest using both features QT and RR interval, in comparison to the accuracy that was found when either one of the features was used.

AB  - Iridology is one alternative ways to know the health condition of the human organs. In iridology, the existance of broken tissue on the iris image in a certain area is representing the condition of a specific organ. Renal or kidneys are the example of the organs that can be seen through the iris. Focus of this research is to analyze the iris image of patient Chronic Renal Failure (CRF). According to the GFR (Glomerular Fitration Rate) in the blood of the patients, CRF could reached 5 stages. In this paper the analysis was limited to the patients of CRF who have already been in hemodialysis treatment (stage 5). The number of hemodialysis patients who participated in this research was 40 people. The iris image of CRF patients were taken using specific iris camera. Watershed transform technique was used to extract the features of iris image of hemodialysis patients. The ROI (region of interest) of iris image of renal organ is at 5.35-5.95 (252° - 268°) for right eye and at 6.05-6.6 (272° - 288°) for left eye assuming that the circle of iris is dividedinto 120 points (3600). The medical records of patients were used to validate the result of this iridology study.The result shows that 90% of patients hemodialysis has shown broken tissue on their right iris and 94% has shown broken tissue on their left iris. In conclusion, the condition of renal organ of CRF patients can be seen through the broken tissue in iris image.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus and its complication such as heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, etc. is a serious concern all over the world. Hence, monitoring some important blood parameters non-invasively is of utmost importance, that too with high accuracy. This paper presents an in-house developed system, which will be helpful for diabetes patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to monitor blood urea and glucose. This manuscript discusses a comparative study for the prediction of blood urea and glucose using Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (BP- ANN) and Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) model. The NVIDIA Jetson Nano board controls the five fixed LED wavelengths in the Near Infrared (NIR) region from  $2.0~\mu \text{m}$  to  $2.5~\mu \text{m}$  with a constant emission power of 1.2 mW. The spectra for 57 laboratory prepared samples conforming with major blood constituents of the blood sample were recorded. From these samples, 53 spectra were used for training/calibration of the BP-ANN/PLSR model and the remaining 4 samples were used for validating the model. The PLSR model predicts blood urea and glucose with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.88 & 12.01 mg/dL, Coefficient of Determination R2 = 0.93 & R2 = 0.97, Accuracy of 94.2 % and 90.14 %, respectively. To improve the prediction accuracy, BP-ANN model is applied. Later the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique was applied to these 57 spectra values. These PCA values were used to train and validate the BP-ANN model. After applying the BP-ANN model, the prediction of blood urea & glucose improved remarkably, which achieved RMSE of 0.69 mg/dL, R2 = 0.96, Accuracy of 95.96 % for urea and RMSE of 2.06 mg/dL, R2 = 0.99, and Accuracy of 98.65 % for glucose. The system performance is then evaluated with Bland Altman analysis and Clarke Error Grid Analysis (CEGA).

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an increasing medical issue that declines the productivity of renal capacities and subsequently damages the kidneys. CKD is very common nowadays; cardiovascular infection and end-stage renal illness are two life threatening diseases that can be caused as after-effects of CKD. These are conceivably preventable through early recognizable conditions and treatment of people who are in danger. The expectation of medical problems is a very troublesome assignment. CKD is particularly one of the most lethal diseases in the clinical field. Before it becomes too late to recognize CKD forecast, to get rid of risks, the prediction of risk factor is a major necessary step in the immediate stage. In this research work six algorithms such as Naïve Bayes, Random forest, Simple logistic regression, Decision Stump, Linear regression model, simple linear regression model is used to predict the risk factors of CKD. Considering the orderly execution and investigations of these strategies, six algorithms give a superior and quicker characterization execution. Six individual algorithms are applied to the dataset and the best outcomes have been acquired through the classification of predicting risk factors.

AB  - The healthcare organization collects large complex healthcare data that are not mined to uncover the hidden information for valid decision making. Discovery of hidden relationships and patterns often goes unexploited. Advanced data mining techniques can be a remedy this situation. Personal Health records have raised as a patient centric healthcare services where the patients health information is accumulated on the cloud. It gives an opportunity for the individuals to create, manage and distribute the data on the cloud. But this involves considering the issues of security and privacy. With technological development cloud services are being used widely and comprises of multiple users and owners of this cloud service, thus results in data management complexity. The objective of the paper is to predict Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD) using classification techniques and emphasize on the consequences of security and data access control of patient health information in the real time application. To manage huge amount of data, a flexible and fine-grained access control solution should be used. A favorable approach has emerged based on Feature Based Encryption, which provides flexible and fine-grained access control. Complexity of key management can be reduced by distributing users into multiple domains. But keys and data on clouds can be intercepted by semi trusted servers. Therefore Advanced Encryption Standard is used for providing high security of data.

The success of CKD prediction usually depend on classifier selected. This paper proposes and evaluates Kernel-based Extreme Learning Machine to predict Chronic Kidney Disease. Subsequently, various kernel-based ELM were evaluated. We compared the performance of four kernels-based ELM, namely RBF-ELM, Linear-ELM, Polynomial-ELM, Wavelet-ELM and the performance of standard ELM. The result showed that radial basis function extrem learning machine (RBF -ELM) was higher than those from the other tested and give the best prediction sensitivity and specificity of 99.38% and 100% respectively.

AB  - Healthcare industry has taken a move towards modernization and has stepped into creating electronic health records which is generating massive data. Data generated from health care industry is huge in volume and highly unstructured in nature, it is thus important to structure the data and leverage its actual potential. One of the major contributors of mortality and morbidity in developing countries like India is a non communicable disease, chronic kidney failure. Early diagnosis of a disease becomes significantly important and needs more attention. This survey paper discusses overview of the researches done in this area. Based on the survey it is found that not much significant work has been done in this area. This paper also gives an insight how big data from Health care can be analyzed using predictive analytics method by exploiting the potential of Hadoop / Map Reduce tool. The benefit of implementing this technique would be that the disease would be diagnosed at an early stage based on the various symptoms of the patient and thus can help patients to get right cure and care at a right time which will lead to better health.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease can be detected with several automatic diagnosis systems. In this study, chronic kidney diseases are diagnosed with Adaboost ensemble learning algorithm. Decision tree based classifiers are used in the diagnosis. The classification performance are evaluated with kappa, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE) and area under curve (AUC) criterias. Considering the performance analyses, it is observed that adaboost ensemble learning algorithm provides better classification performance than individual classification.

AB  - The complexity, variability, quantitative nature, and data density of treatment for chronic kidney failure make dialysis information systems excellent candidates for computerized decision support. We describe the development of an intelligent system building on existing knowledge and susceptible to reconfiguration on the basis of knowledge acquired during the use of the system. Various decision support techniques were used to design and develop the decision support modules. This paper briefly reviews the literature on clinical decision support, discusses some of the problems faced by practitioners in managing chronic kidney failure (end-stage renal disease) patients, and sets forth the decision support techniques used in developing a dialysis decision support system.

T2  - 2021 12th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)
AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) refers to the disorder in kidneys where it can't filter extra water and wastes out of the blood to make urine as normally. The infection is classified “chronic” in light of the fact that the harm to kidneys occurs gradually throughout a significant stretch of time. This harm can make squanders develop in the body. The cause for the CKD is mostly uncertain and there are several factors that influences in this disease, Among the many, the primary cause for this CKD are diabetes and hypertension. Both are liable for up to 66% of the cases other than that heart disease. It is conceivable to slow or stop the movement of kidney disease if it is properly treated in the early stages of infection/damage. In present research, we are trying to capture the explanatory cases from patient description and produce the explanations so that it can be easily understood by the experts as well as the layman. Usually, the predicted values that are obtained from any of the machine learning model are efficient. However, the results are opaque thus it requires an explanation for those cases like which factors are impacting for the disease, is achieved using LIME (Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations) algorithm.

AB  - The chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become more common non communicable disease in the world. It is one of the non curable life threatening disease spreading in India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Bangladesh and almost all other parts of the globe. The prevalence of this disease is increasing unexpectedly and about 10% of people of any age have some kind of CKD. Non-curability and non-detection of this disease make it more harmful and dangerous as its symptoms are hidden till 90% of kidney functions fail. Detection of this disease at its early stage is a major and significant task for medical experts. A computer based intelligent system can be very useful in this situation that can diagnose the kidney disease and its stages. This paper presents a survey on medical expert systems developed for disease diagnosis using different techniques.

TI  - TabNet to Identify Risks in Chronic Kidney Disease Using GAN's Synthetic Data
AU  - P. Kiran Rao

T2  - 2022 2nd International Conference on Technological Advancements in Computational Sciences (ICTACS)
AB  - The objective of this study was to develop a system for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to identify relevant prognostic features using a clinical dataset. Accurate classification and major risk factors in chronic kidney disease lead to better prognosis and assist nephrologists. Due to privacy and other factors, the data source is not balanced to trail any models. Therefore, it is difficult to achieve consistent accuracy with an imbalanced dataset, and there will be a variance in results with different machine learning models. In the proposed study, GAN's generated synthesised dataset, which is very close to the original dataset, is used. A hybrid synthesised dataset consists of the original dataset along with the synthesised data generated with the GAN model. The proposed model also includes the most important risk variables for CKD. The metrics used in the study include F1-score, accuracy, and from the plot, it shows that the TabNet with GAN's synthetic data is more consistent and more accurate than the traditional machine learning techniques with imbalanced dataset. The proposed model iterated for 150 times to get the variance, which is much less than in proposed techniques with hybrid preprocessed datasets. The proposed work significantly increased the classification accuracy of chronic kidney disease. These models and parameters show how important health status data is for predicting the risk of and development of kidney disease.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease is the reason for many deaths all over the world every year. Chronic kidney disease has troubled almost 753 million people all over the world in 2016, wherein 417 million are females and 336 million are males. In the year 2015, it was the reason for 1.2 million deaths all over the world. When CKD is detected in the later stage of a diabetes patient, it is very harmful to them. Sometimes it leads them to death. But if it is possible to detect chronic kidney disease at an early stage of diabetes patients, the damage can be minimized. This research paper has shown a comparative analysis on the performance of some algorithms - Multilayer Perceptron, Bagging, and Adaboost. And this research work has also used some algorithms such as Bagging (J48), Bagging (Random Tree), Bagging (Decision Stump), Bagging (LMT), Adaboost (Random Tree), Adaboost (Decision Stump), Adaboost (J48), Adaboost (Random Forest). Our comparison of different algorithms will help people having diabetes to figure out whether they will have CKD or not in the future. From all these algorithms Bagging (Random Tree) and AdaBoost (Random Forest) have the best result. By comparing the results of all algorithms, the best algorithm can be detected for predicting the chronic kidney disease. This study can save many people's lives and money. Doctors can also be benefitted from this research.

AB  - Millions of patients worldwide suffer from Kidney failure and require dialysis. In most cases, dialysis is started after the kidney function of the patient falls below a threshold. In this scenario the patients kidney is essentially non functional. In order to conduct dialysis, native arteriovenous fistulas are constructed to increase blood flow in the superficial vein, and hence facilitate dialysis. Over time, as dialysis continues, the patient may suffer from hypertension and reduced vein function leading to the collapse of the fistula. The ultrasound doppler test for checking the state of the fistula are expensive and doing it again and again is not feasible. We study work related to Chronic Kidney Disease which provides similar data points to those required for the health of the fistula and propose a mechanism to predict the life of a fistula.

AB  - Chronic Renal Disease (CRD) or Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is defined as the continuous loss of kidney function. It's a long-term condition in which the kidney or renal doesn't work properly, gets damaged and can't filter blood on a regular basis. Diabetes, high blood pressure, swollen feet, ankles or hands and other disorders can cause chronic renal disease. By gradual progression and lack of treatment, it can lead to kidney failure. A prior prognosis of CKD can nourish the quality of life to a higher range in such circumstances and can enhance the attribute of life to a larger province. Now a days, bioscience is playing a significant role in the aspect of diagnosing and detecting numerous health conditions. Machine Learning (ML) as well as Data Mining (DM) methods are playing the leading role in the realm of biosciences. Our objective is to predict and diagnose (CKD) with some machine learning algorithms. In this study, an attempt to diagnose chronic renal disease has been taken with four ML algorithms named XGBoost, Adaboost, Logistic Regression (LR) as well as Random Forest (RF). By using decision tree-based classifiers and analyzing the dataset with comparing their performance, we attempted to diagnose CKD in this study. The results of the model in this study showed prosperous indications of a better prognosis for the diagnosis of kidney diseases. Considering and contemplating the performance analysis, it is accomplished that Random Forest ensemble learning algorithm provides better classification performance than other classification methods.

AB  - The introduction of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is causing fast transformation in healthcare. EHR contains the patient private information and health history in digital form. Hence, EHR data cannot be shared due to privacy concerns to the Machine Learning(ML) research community, through which we can make the healthcare system smarter and provide quality healthcare services to the patients. As a result, synthetic data is utilised as a backup when real-world data (such as EHR data) is unavailable. Synthetic data can be shared without revealing any private information of the patient. This paper focuses on generating synthetic data from the real dataset. As a use case, we have selected Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD) dataset (real) and generated three datasets – real, synthetic, and a combination of real + synthetic. To test the accuracy of the synthetic data, we ran six supervised machine learning algorithms on these three datasets with all characteristics and reduced features to see if the patient had CKD or not. Supervised ML algorithms on the three datasets are assessed based on the following performance metrics - Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F1-Score. According to the results, XGBoost surpasses with 100 percent accuracy on all three datasets with full features and a 100 percent accuracy on the mix of real and synthetic datasets with feature reduction.

AB  - Hyperkalemia is common for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and it is often the cause of sudden cardiac death when it is not monitored. The detection of dyskalemias currently depends on laboratory tests. Reliable and rapid detection is therefore necessary. The electrocardiogram (ECG) can meet this need and improve the automatic detection of different levels of hyperkalemia before laboratory results. In this paper, we proposed a method that could be used to estimate blood kalemia levels based on a representation of ECG signals as images using two approaches: Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and the time elapsed between two successive R-waves of the QRS signal on the electrocardiogram. Both images are fed to a convolutional neural network (CNN) that improved the monitoring routine without the need for invasive blood testing.

AB  - Data is a collection of information from the activities of the real world. The file in which such data is stored after transforming into a form that machines can process is generally known as data set. In the real world, many data sets are not complete, and they contain various types of noise. Missing values is of one such kind. Thus, imputing data of these missing values is one of the significant task of data pre-processing. This paper deals with two real time health care data sets namely life expectancy (LE) dataset and chronic kidney disease (CKD) dataset, which are very different in their nature. This paper provides insights on various data imputation techniques to fill missing values by analyzing them. When coming to Data imputation, it is very common to impute the missing values with measure of central tendencies like mean, median, mode Which can represent the central value of distribution but choosing the apt choice is real challenge. In accordance with best of our knowledge this is the first and foremost paper which provides the complete analysis of impact of basic data imputation techniques on various data distributions which can be classified based on the size of data set, number of missing values, type of data (categorical/numerical), etc. This paper compared and analyzed the original data distribution with the data distribution after each imputation in terms of their skewness, outliers and by various descriptive statistic parameters.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) describes a long-term decline in kidney function and has many causes. It affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide every year. It can have a strong negative impact on patients, especially when combined with cardiovascular disease (CVD): patients with both conditions have lower survival chances. In this context, computational intelligence applied to electronic health records can provide insights to physicians that can help them make better decisions about prognoses or therapies. In this study we applied machine learning to medical records of patients with CKD and CVD. First, we predicted if patients develop severe CKD, both including and excluding information about the year it occurred or date of the last visit. Our methods achieved top mean Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of +0.499 in the former case and a mean MCC of +0.469 in the latter case. Then, we performed a feature ranking analysis to understand which clinical factors are most important: age, eGFR, and creatinine when the temporal component is absent; hypertension, smoking, and diabetes when the year is present. We then compared our results with the current scientific literature, and discussed the different results obtained when the time feature is excluded or included. Our results show that our computational intelligence approach can provide insights about diagnosis and relative important of different clinical variables that otherwise would be impossible to observe.

TI  - Collaborative Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining: From Knowledge to Experience
AU  - T. Horeis

T2  - 2007 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Data Mining
AB  - Experts have important qualitative knowledge about interrelations between more or less abstract concepts in an application area. However, the knowledge of a single expert is typically quite uncertain (e.g., incomplete or imprecise). By fusing the knowledge of several experts it would be possible to obtain more certain and, therefore, more valuable knowledge. Conventional systems for knowledge discovery (KD) and data mining (DM) have the ability to extract valid rules from huge data sets. These rules describe dependencies between attributes and classes in a quantitative way, for instance. By fusing this kind of knowledge with the combined, qualitative knowledge of several experts it would be possible to obtain more comprehensive knowledge about an application area. In this article, we propose a concept for a new KD & DM technique based on computational intelligence: collaborative knowledge discovery (CKD). These techniques combines the uncertain knowledge of several experts using methods based on Dempster-Shafer theory. The combined human knowledge is again fused with automatically extracted, well interpretable knowledge (fuzzy rules embedded in a radial basis function neural network) of a conventional KD system. Thus, a CKD system not only acquires more comprehensive knowledge, but also experience (knowledge about knowledge), meaning that it is able to explain automatically extracted rules to the human experts and to assess the interestingness (e.g., novelty or utility) of these rules. This can be done by adapting inference mechanisms from the field of probabilistic argumentation systems. A CKD system will comprise self-awareness mechanisms (it must know what it knows) as well as environment-awareness mechanisms (it must know what human experts know or what they want to now). In order to reduce the effort for knowledge acquisition, a CKD system must learn (pro-)actively. There are many application areas for such CKD systems, e.g., in the field of technical data mining (quality control, process monitoring, etc.)

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a menace that is affecting 10 percent of the world population and 15 percent of the South African population. The early and cheap diagnosis of this disease with accuracy and reliability will save 20,000 lives in South Africa per year. Scientists are developing smart solutions with Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this paper, several typical and recent AI algorithms are studied in the context of CKD and the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is chosen as our base model for its high performance. Then, the model is optimized and the optimal full model trained on all the features achieves a testing accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 1.000, 1.000, and 1.000, respectively. Note that, to cover the widest range of people, the time and monetary costs of CKD diagnosis have to be minimized with fewest patient tests. Thus, the reduced model using fewer features is desirable while it should still maintain high performance. To this end, the set-theory based rule is presented which combines a few feature selection methods with their collective strengths. The reduced model using about a half of the original full features performs better than the models based on individual feature selection methods and achieves accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, of 1.000, 1.000, and 1.000, respectively.

AB  - Diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has mainly significant in the medical field of data mining. The objective of this paper is to predict chronic kidney disease using only nominal attributes which results compared to numerical and both nominal and numerical attributes. The classification and prediction of this paper presents correlation based feature selection (CFS) technique applied to extract important attributes and classifying them into CKD and not CKD. The CFS approach is applied on the data types of nominal, numerical and both nominal and numerical attributes in feature selection. The result of the CFS approach compared to three ranker approaches such as Information Gain, Gain Ratio, and ReliefF approach for feature selection. The accuracy of correlation based feature selection and sequential minimum optimization (CFS-SMO) approach achieved 98.5% for nominal, 95.25% for numerical and 98.5% for nominal and numerical. These experimental results declare that the correlation based feature selection (CFS) successfully extracted features from the benchmark approval of own and original chronic kidney disease (CKD) dataset and SMO classified the status of kidney disease. Therefore CFS-SMO considered as an optimistic tool to diagnosis kidney disease accurately which supports medical experts to make decision correctly.

AB  - The prime use of the classification technique is to predict the target class accurately for each case in the dataset. The recent study is focused on the usage of classification techniques in the field of medical science and bioinformatics. The main focus of this paper is to predict Chronic- Kidney-Disease and its usage for classification in the field of medical bioinformatics. It firstly classifies dataset and then determines which algorithm performs better for diagnosis and prediction of Chronic- Kidney-Disease. Thus, the prime objective of this paper is to analyze the data from a chronic- kidney-disease (CKD) dataset using classification technique to predict class accurately in each case. Many researchers have compared the performance of different classifiers applied on various datasets. But, none of the author worked on prediction of accuracy for chronic-kidney-disease dataset. Here, we have considered two critical classifiers to study their performance based on various parameters obtained by applying them in the dataset.

AB  - The management and diagnosis of CKD or Renal Failure is often complicated. Maximum risk associated with lack of knowledge, poor health management, and indifferent lifestyle can be considered as primary reasons for increasing cause of this disease. Basically, Chronic Renal Disease is intensifying the damage of kidneys over a duration. Decreased or damaged kidney is often determined using GFR, which is also known as golemerular filtration rate. However, it can be cured or prevented if diagnosed and identified at an early stage or else dialysis and transplantation will be needed for further mishaps. Identifying CKD is can be very complex, proper medical test are needed. Several attributes from the medical test can reveal many useful information about Chronic Kidney Disease. To successfully use these features the significance of these features should be analyzed with greater details in order to provide the required treatment or cure. In this paper, classification models were suggested using different classifying algorithms, Permutation Feature Importance, Correlation-based Feature Subset attribute evaluator and GreedyStepwise search methods are used to classify and identify CKD and non-CKD patients. From the obtained result, it was observed that classifiers performed better with reduced dataset attributes as compare to the original.

AB  - Improvements in the technology made to collect huge amounts of data. As there is a vast amount of data available in the present digital world, it is a difficult task to handle, manage, maintain and train the model using that large data. Large amounts of features make the machine learning model complex. So, Feature Selection is a significant and trending task in this era. In order to get best results of a predicting model, identifying the best subset of features plays a key role. Tuning of the best features seems to be an effortful task. The proposed methodology called Binary Teaching Learning Based Optimization Algorithm (BTLBO) makes it easier. The common controlling parameters for the proposed system are population size and number of iterations. The optimization technique is applied on the fitness function, which is accuracy. To prove that the proposed model is efficient, the model is applied on five different datasets like Diabetes, Thyroid, Parkinson, Breast Cancer and Heart are used with different classification algorithms like Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN). The proposed model is validated with the performance metric Accuracy and compared with other algorithms. The proposed model obtained better results when compared to existing techniques.

AB  - The kidneys are one of the important organs for humans with various tasks to keep humans healthy. One of them is to remove excess water and toxins from the blood. The chronic kidney is a disease that interferes with kidney function that is progressive and irreversible in which the body's ability to fail to maintain metabolism and fluid and electrolyte balance resulting in uremia. There have been many studies aimed at predicting chronic kidney disease. In this study, using the C4.5 algorithm as a classification algorithm and by adding the Adaboost algorithm. The results showed that using the algorithm obtained an accuracy value of 95%, 92% precision, and Area Under the Curve by 1. Whereas using the algorithm combined with Adaboost got an accuracy value is precision, and Area Under the Curve by 1. Based on the results accuracy, precision, and Area Under the Curve, it can be seen by using Adaboost in the algorithm can improve the results of accuracy and precision with very good classification, because the Area Under the Curve value is accepted.

AB  - This work presents an algorithm for automatic analysis of QT dispersion (QTd) on 3 quasi-orthogonal leads (DI, aVF and V2) of ECG, based on the wavelet transform (WT). In a first step, QRS complexes and T waves of different morphologies are detected in each one of the three leads. Next, each QT interval is delineated by detecting and identifying the characteristic points as QRS onset (Qi) and T wave end (Te). Finally, mean of three consecutive QT intervals of the same beats in each lead is calculated to measure QTd. The accuracy of the algorithm developed has been validated with recordings of the manually annotated QT database, by comparing its results with manual annotations of an expert cardiologist, showing that the error obtained is within the tolerance range defined by each characteristic point, Qi and Te. The algorithm has been applied in a study to evaluate QTd in recordings of 7 normal subjects and 7 renal insufficiency patients from the PTB diagnostic ECG database. The results show that the QTd algorithm is effective in differentiating both groups. (p=0.004).

AB  - There has been growing interest recently in using machine learning techniques as an aid in clinical medicine. Machine learning offers a range of classification algorithms which can be applied to medical data to aid in making clinical predictions. Recent studies have demonstrated the high predictive accuracy of various classification algorithms applied to clinical data. Several studies have already been conducted in diagnosing or predicting chronic kidney disease at various stages using different sets of variables. In this study we are investigating the use of machine learning techniques with blood test data. Such a system could aid renal teams in making recommendations to primary care general practitioners to refer patients to secondary care where patients may benefit from earlier specialist assessment and medical intervention. We are able to achieve an overall accuracy of 88.48% using logistic regression, 87.12% using ANN and 85.29% using SVM. ANNs performed with the highest sensitivity at 89.74 % compared to 86.67 % for logistic regression and 85.51 % for SVM.

AB  - Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been widely applied in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), syndrome classification is a very important step in the diagnosis of TCM. Based on clinical diagnosis experiences and the analogy theory of TCM, we propose a method that is grounded on analogy theory of TCM for syndrome diagnosis (ATTSCM). The ATTSCM method utilizes the feature selection algorithm to select the significant symptoms, and the clustering algorithm combine multi-label learning algorithm to distinguish the syndromes. The proposed method is evaluated by the chronic kidney disease dataset which is collated by University of Chinese Medicine. Three evaluation measures of multi-label classification are taken to evaluate the performance of syndrome classification, including classification accuracy, micro F1 measure and hamming loss. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs well in the application for TCM syndrome differentiation of CKD.

AB  - Classification of ultrasound (US) kidney images for diagnosis of congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) in children is a challenging task. It is desirable to improve existing pattern classification models that are built upon conventional image features. In this study, we propose a transfer learning-based method to extract imaging features from US kidney images in order to improve the CAKUT diagnosis in children. Particularly, a pre-trained deep learning model (imagenet-caffe-alex) is adopted for transfer learning-based feature extraction from 3-channel feature maps computed from US images, including original images, gradient features, and distanced transform features. Support vector machine classifiers are then built upon different sets of features, including the transfer learning features, conventional imaging features, and their combination. Experimental results have demonstrated that the combination of transfer learning features and conventional imaging features yielded the best classification performance for distinguishing CAKUT patients from normal controls based on their US kidney images.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is still a health concern despite advances in surgical care and treatment. CKD’s growth in recent years has gained much interest from researchers around the world in developing high-performance methods for diagnosis, treatment and preventive therapy. Improved performance can be accomplished by learning the features that are in the concern of the problem. In addition to the clinical examination, analysis of the medical data for the patients can help the health care partners to predict the disease in early stage. Although there are many tries to build intelligent systems to predict the CKD by analysis the health data, the performance of these systems still need enhancement. This Paper proposes an intelligent classification and prediction model. It uses modified Deep Belief Network (DBN) as classification algorithm to predict the kidney related diseases and the Softmax as activation function and the Categorical Cross-entropy as a loss function. The evaluation of the proposed model shows that the model can predict the CKD with accuracy 98.5% and sensitivity 87.5 % comparing with existing models. Result analysis proves that using advanced deep learning techniques is beneficial for clinical decision making and can aid in early prediction of CKD and its related phases that reduces the progression of the kidney damage.

AB  - Precise investigation of clinical data with the improvement of AI in clinical and clinical associations can help in early identification and treatment of patients with general exercises. The lack of clinical data decreases the reality of the regulation. Explicit indications of sickness in various locales show up in various districts, which might diminish the capacity to predict the illness. The proposed framework develops a calculation based on AI to precisely predict the presence of different sicknesses among the general public. This study attempts to develop a model for registering the clinical information gathered, in actuality. To overcome the issue of deficient data, stowed away articles are utilized to recuperate lost data. The finding of persistent territorial infection is called stroke. AI based machine calculation is utilized with structured and unstructured data. It predicts illnesses that can take advantage of mining, for example, Kovid-19, chronic kidney disease, and heart disease. Apparently of cutting-edge clinical examination, no movement is centered around this sort of data. Contrasted with most regular calculations, the real estimation of the calculation requested is 94.8%, which is quicker than the calculation used for the investigation of sickness brought about by the calculation.

AB  - The chronic kidney disease is the loss of kidney function. Often time, the symptoms of the disease is not noticeable and a significant amount of lives are lost annually due to the disease. Using machine learning algorithm for medical studies, the disease can be predicted with a high accuracy rate and a very short time. Using four of the supervised classification learning algorithms, i.e., logistic regression, Decision tree, Random Forest and KNN algorithms, the prediction of the disease can be done. In the paper, the performance of the predictions of the algorithms are analyzed using a pre-processed dataset. The performance analysis is done base on the accuracy of the results, prediction time, ROC and AUC Curve and error rate. The comparison of the algorithms will suggest which algorithm is best fit for predicting the chronic kidney disease.

AB  - Missing values in large datasets have become a difficult task for researchers and industrialists. Specifically in the field of medicine, the datasets contain missing values due to human error or non-availability of data. If these datasets have to utilized for inference purposes or predictive studies, the resutls are not that reliable. Discarding such instances is an option but effects overall accuracy and thus it is viable to perform some replacement or imputation technique. Here, imputaiton technique enable to estimate the missing values in the datasets by applying various algorithms. Therefore, in this paper we present a framework that assists in imouting missing values in a large Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) datasets. We have used three machine learning algorithms i.e., K-Nearest Neighbors, K-Means and K-Medoids Clustering to impute the missing values. Performance evaluation of the proposed technique has been carried out by application of Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that KNN algorithm provides the most accurate results compared with K-Means and K-Medoids clustering algorithms. KNN achieves an accuracy of 86.67% for Decision Tree algorithm, and 75.25% for Random Forest algorithm. Additionally it also has a less relative, absolute and root mean square error. Conclusively, KNN imputed datasets are used in our research for future predictions.

It is one of the critical known health concerns with rising demand for early detection for prosperous and sustainable care. Many factors (such as Haemoglobin, Blood Pressure, diabetes, obesity) contribute to the continuous decline of kidney function over time. Chronic kidney disease has many stages for the criticality of the disease. Hence, a better diagnosis of chronic kidney disease is required to prevent continuous progression. This work gives a comprehensive study of the bio-clinical phenotype of cases with high-risk of Chronic kidney disease and will repeatedly assess victims over the long term and helps in classifying the stage of chronic kidney disease and then provides better recommendations (food, medicine) to prevent the rise of chronic kidney disease.

AB  - In recent years, the advent of latest web and data technologies has encouraged massive data growth in almost every sector. Businesses and leading industries are viewing these huge data repositories as a tool to design future strategies, prediction models by analyzing patterns and gaining knowledge from this unstructured data by applying different data mining techniques. Medical domain has now become richer in term of maintaining digital records of patients related to their diagnosis and treatment. These huge data repositories can range from patient personnel data, diagnosis, treatment histories, test diagnosis, images and various scans. This terabytes of medical data is quantity rich but weaker in information in terms of knowledge and robust tools to identify hidden patterns of knowledge specifically in medical sector. Data Mining as a field of research has already well proven capabilities of identifying hidden patterns, analysis and knowledge applied on different research domains, now gaining popularity day by day among researchers and scientist towards generating novel and deep insights of these large biomedical datasets also. Uncovering new biomedical and healthcare related knowledge in order to support clinical decision making, is another dimension of data mining. Through massive literature survey, it is found that early disease prediction is the most demanded area of research in health care sector. As health care domain is bit wider domain and having different disease characteristics, different techniques have their own prediction efficiencies, which can be enhanced and changed in order to get into most optimize way. In this research work, authors have comprehensively compared different data classification techniques and their prediction accuracy for chronic kidney disease. Authors have compared J48, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM and k-NN classifiers using performance measures like ROC, kappa statistics, RMSE and MAE using WEKA tool. Authors have also compared these classifiers on various accuracy measures like TP rate, FP rate, precision, recall and f-measure by implementing on WEKA. Experimental result shows that random forest classifier has better classification accuracy over others for chronic kidney disease dataset.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a gradual loss of renal function over time, and it increases the risk of mortality, decreased quality of life, as well as serious complications. The prevalence of CKD has been increasing in the last couple of decades, which is partly due to the increased prevalence of diabetes and hypertension. To accurately detect CKD in diabetic patients, we propose a novel framework to learn sparse longitudinal representations of patients' medical records. The proposed method is also compared with widely used baselines such as Aggregated Frequency Vector and Bag-of-Pattern in Sequences on real EHR data, and the experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive performance. Additionally, the learned representations are interpreted and visualized to bring clinical insights.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health concern with rising prevalence. In this study we consider 24 predictive parameters and create a machine learning classifier to detect CKD. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 400 individuals, where 250 of them have CKD. Using our approach we achieve a detection accuracy of 0.993 according to the F1-measure with 0.1084 root mean square error. This is a 56% reduction of mean square error compared to the state of the art (i.e., the CKD-EPI equation: a glomerular filtration rate estimator). We also perform feature selection to determine the most relevant attributes for detecting CKD and rank them according to their predictability. We identify new predictive attributes which have not been used by any previous GFR estimator equations. Finally, we perform a cost-accuracy tradeoff analysis to identify a new CKD detection approach with high accuracy and low cost.

AB  - Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects millions of men worldwide. Men with ED generally complain failure to attain or maintain an adequate erection during sexual activity. The prevalence of ED is strongly correlated with age, affecting about 40% of men at age 40 and nearly 70% at age 70. A variety of chronic diseases, including diabetes, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, depression, chronic renal failure, obstructive sleep apnea, prostate disease, gout, and sleep disorder, were reported to be associated with ED. In this study, data retrieved from a subset of the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan were used for designing the clinical decision support system (CDSS) for predicting ED incidences in men. The positive cases were male patients aged 20-65 who were diagnosed with ED between January 2000 and December 2010 confirmed by at least three outpatient visits or at least one inpatient visit, while the negative cases were randomly selected from the database without a history of ED and were frequency (1:1), age, and index year matched with the ED patients. Data of a total of 2832 ED patients and 2832 non-ED.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease is a kidney disease in which there is a function loss of kidney and it is occurred overtimes and years. This disease is perceptible until the kidney losses 25% of its function. Chronic kidney disease requires a correct and appropriate diagnostic process in order to provide relevant and proper treatment which is in accordance with the diagnosis. Using current developed technology, the diagnosis process can be easily conducted. The diagnosis can be carried out by employing data mining techniques such as clustering and classification. This study seeks to explore the implementation of the K-Means algorithm as a clustering algorithm and Support Vector Machine algorithm as a classification algorithm. Clustering process is used to determine data on the pure cluster then the data will be classified using the Support Vector Machine algorithm. In the classification process with the Support Vector Machine algorithm, various non-linear kernels such as polynomial kernels, RBF kernels, and sigmoid kernels are used. Based on the research results, the highest accuracy is obtained from the classification process with two clusters, which is 100% in all kernel functions. As for the highest accuracy in the classification with three clusters, four clusters, and five clusters are generated by the classification process using the RBF kernel.

AB  - chronic kidney disease is a disorder that disables normal kidney function. The WHO has shown that CKD is a serious disease, ranked as one of the top twenty causes of death. It is recognized that2 million people worldwide suffer from kidney failure and the number of patients diagnosed with CDK continues to expand at a rate of 5-7% annually. late diagnosis of this disease is a life-threatening problem, which, often occurs in remote areas due to the lack of specialized medical personnel, in addition to the high cost of diagnosis. This paper aims at early detection of CDK using machine learning algorithms Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and k-Nearest Neighbor. The importance of AI is reflected in the importance of identifying these typically fatal ailments. This study looks at a data set consisting of 400 samples and 13 features. The three classification techniques were evaluated by applying them to the data. The results show that the ANN classifier achieved the best accuracy at 99.2%.

AB  - Chronic Kidney disease (CKD), a slow and late-diagnosed disease, is one of the most important problems of mortality rate in the medical sector nowadays. Based on this critical issue, a significant number of men and women are now suffering due to the lack of early screening systems and appropriate care each year. However, patients’ lives can be saved with the fast detection of disease in the earliest stage. In addition, the evaluation process of machine learning algorithm can detect the stage of this deadly disease much quicker with a reliable dataset. In this paper, the overall study has been implemented based on four reliable approaches, such as Support Vector Machine (henceforth SVM), AdaBoost (henceforth AB), Linear Discriminant Analysis (henceforth LDA), and Gradient Boosting (henceforth GB) to get highly accurate results of prediction. These algorithms are implemented on an online dataset of UCI machine learning repository. The highest predictable accuracy is obtained from Gradient Boosting (GB) Classifiers which is about to 99.80% accuracy. Later, different performance evaluation metrics have also been displayed to show appropriate outcomes. To end with, the most efficient and optimized algorithms for the proposed job can be selected depending on these benchmarks.

A new sensing approach is introduced to monitor the urea levels in the saliva sample. Furthermore, for analyzing the raw signals obtained from the sensor, we have implemented a one-dimensional deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm, which is incorporated with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The use of CNN-SVM integrated network enhanced the classification accuracy of the model. The proposed model successfully classified the samples with an accuracy of 98.04%.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is when the kidneys are no longer working normally as they used to be, and filtering the blood was one of their obligations. The condition is classified as "chronic" since the kidney damage occurs gradually over time. This will cause waste to build up in the body. This study is aimed to predict the stages suffered by Chronic Kidney Disease patients, which might help in early detection and prevention. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) serves as the foundation for the prediction system developed by MathWorks and the missing data analysis will be done by using IBM SPSS Statistic 21. The work will show the feature selection and classification-based methods to enhance the performance accuracy of the algorithm in giving effective analysis and prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease. In conclusion, the accuracy achieved by using SVM with 50% holdout validation had the highest accuracy percentage of 93.5% out of other types of validation involved for the analysis of the datasets.

AB  - Kidney disease or commonly known as kidney failure is a condition when the renal function is declining that could result in the inability of the kidneys to perform their duties. Kidney disease patients have the potential to get into the chronic phase. Chronic kidney disease is a decrease in kidney function gradually during the three months which resulted in the cessation of kidney function in total. The purpose of this development is a decision support system for a doctor in diagnosing of the kidney disease patients. The system displays the results of predicting whether patients with renal disease have entered a phase of chronic kidney disease or not. The methodology of this study consists of two main phases: classification modeling and system development. Classification modeling consists of data collection, data preparation, data grouping, classification, rules extraction. System development was based on the extracted rules before. This study resulted in a system that can detect a chronic condition of kidney disease based on several factors with an accuracy of 98.34%.

AB  - Currently, there are many people in the world suffering from chronic kidney diseases worldwide. Due to the several risk factors like food, environment and living standards many people get diseases suddenly without understanding of their condition. Diagnosing of chronic kidney diseases is generally invasive, costly, time-consuming and often risky. That is why many patients reach late stages of it without treatment, especially in those countries where the resources are limited. Therefore, the early detection strategy of the disease remains important, particularly in developing countries, where the diseases are generally diagnosed in late stages. Finding a solution for above-mentioned problems and riding out from disadvantages became a strong motive to conduct this study. In this research study, the effects of using clinical features to classify patients with chronic kidney disease by using support vector machines algorithm is investigated. The chronic kidney disease dataset is based on clinical history, physical examinations, and laboratory tests. Experimental results showed over 93% of success rate in classifying the patients with kidney diseases based on three performance metrics i.e., accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.

AB  - The rising number of deaths due to kidney failure is of great concern. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a disorder where people’s kidneys are damaged and unable to filter blood properly. This damage can cause accumulation of toxins in the body. CKD will become irreversible if timely treatment is not given. Many strategies and machine learning techniques have been developed to detect CKD at an initial state of the disease. Out of all available strategies, machine learning (ML) techniques have been contributing a major role in the early prediction of several diseases. The ML methods used to obtain analytical results have shown great performance in terms of analysis and prediction. In this research paper, we use predictive analysis of ML classifiers for categorizing the patient’s kidney data either as Chronic Kidney Disease or No Chronic Kidney Disease. Here the algorithms namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) have been used in the prediction of the disease. The performances were evaluated using various accuracy criteria.

AB  - Chronic kidney failure (chronic kidney disease ‘CKD’) is a serious disease that related to the gradual loss of kidney function. It is considered one of the health threats in the developing and undeveloped countries At early stages, few symptoms can be detected, where the CKD may not become obvious until significant kidney function impaired occur. CKD treatment focuses on reducing the kidney damage progression by controlling the underlying cause, which requires disease detection at initial stages. In early addition, the financial burden of the treatment and future consequences of CKD requires early detection. In the present work a modified Cuckoo Search (MCS) trained Neural Network (NN) or NN-MCS based model is proposed to detect CKD. The NN-MCS model has been proposed to overcome the problem of using local search based learning algorithms to train the NNs. The NN weight vector is optimized by applying MCS for NN training. A comparative study with eminent classifiers, namely the Multilayer Perceptron Feed-forward Network (MLP-FFN) and NN based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO-NN). The classifiers performance is measured in terms of different performance metrics. The experimental results depicted that the NN-MCS has the ability to detect CKD more efficiently compared to any other existing model.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD), is also known as chronic nephritic sickness. It defines constrains which affects your kidneys and reduces your potential to stay healthy. There will be various complication concerns like increased levels in your blood, anemia (low blood count), weak bones, and nerve injury. Detection and treatment should be done prior so it will typically keep chronic uropathy from obtaining a worse condition. Data processing is the term used for information discovery from big databases. The task of knowledge mining is to generate regular patterns from historical data and emphasize future conclusions, follows from the convergence of many recent trends: the decreased value of huge knowledge storage devices and therefore the tremendous ease of aggregation knowledge over networks; the development of robust and economical machine learning algorithms to method this data; and therefore the decrease value of machine power, enabling use of computationally intensive strategies for knowledge analysis. Machine learning is an important task as it benefits many applications such as analyzing life science outcomes, sleuthing fraud, sleuthing faux users etc. varied knowledge mining classification approaches and machine learning algorithms are applied for prediction of chronic diseases. Therefore, this paper examines the performance of Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Random Forest classifier on the basis of its accuracy, preciseness and execution time for CKD prediction. Finally, the outcome after conducted research is that the performance of Random Forest classifier is finest than Naive Bayes and KNN.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a global health issue and symptoms are not always visible at the early stage. Deep learning techniques can be developed to determine the factors that potentially cause CKD at an early stage to enable patients to receive timely treatment. This paper attempts to forecast Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) by analysing a set of attributes. A publicly available dataset with information collected in India was used for carrying out the research. Data was first preprocessed using different techniques to deal with missing values and outliers in the dataset. Next, classification between CKD and notCKD was performed using both Random Forest and Deep Neural network. The results of both methods were compared, and it was found that the proposed DNN model yielded a superior accuracy of 98.8% for the binary classification.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an increasing failure of kidney function leading to kidney failure over the years. The disease settles down and hence makes its diagnosis difficult. Analyzing CKD stages from standard office visit records can assist in premature recognition of the disease and prompt auspicious mediation. Hereby, we propose a methodology using inspired optimization model and learning procedure to classify CKD. The proposed method selects applicable features of kidney data with the help of Ant Lion Optimization (ALO) technique to choose optimal features for the classification process. After that, we sort the CKD data based on chosen features by utilizing Deep Neural Network (DNN). Performance comparison indicates that our proposed model accomplishes better classification accuracy, precision, F-measure, sensitivity measures when compared with other data mining classifiers.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major health condition that causes millions of deaths and billions of dollars in worldwide economic loss. The classical way of diagnosis and treatment of CKDs is through routine blood tests, urine analysis and ultrasonography of kidneys. Though all of these methods are very effective in diagnosis of CKDs, they lack predictive power. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning models are more feasible options to drill in the clinical data and predict the occurrence of CKD from the vital body parameters. This article reviews the major works in the diagnosis of CKDs using Data Mining (DM) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The significant challenges and limitations in the data driven predictive techniques are also discussed. Finally, the future research directions that would improve the predictive power of the models are also highlighted.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD)is a long-term disease in which the kidneys are failed and needed dialysis or kidney transplantation in the severe stage. Thirty-seven million people in the United States have CKD, and millions more are at risk. Early diagnosis can help prevent kidney disease from progressing to kidney failure. The aim of this study is to make CKD diagnosis predictions based on symptoms or characteristics seen in a particular case, regardless of whether the stage is acute or chronic, and to classify the most important features that contribute to CKD. We illustrate machine learning methods to predict chronic kidney disease using clinical evidence and statistical tests to identify the most important reasons for CKD. Seven machine learning methods are explored including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and XGBboost classifiers to predict CKD and two statistical tests including Student’s T-test and chi-squared test to identify most significant features. The results showed that the tree-based classifier performs best in the kidney diagnostic procedure with accuracy of 100%. In addition,hemoglobin, packed cell volume, specific gravity, red bloodcell countsand albumin are the most predictive biomarker for CKD.

AB  - Kidney Disease are most serious worldwide health concern with a high fatality rate, as it might also lead to the development of other diseases. Detecting Chronic Kidney Disease at early stage allows patients to undergo therapy while the disease is still in its early stages, and disease development can be slowed. Machine learning may be utilised to effectively attain this aim due to its rapid recognition execution. The current method forecasts chronic illnesses for a specific region and community. Machine learning methodologies like Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, k-star and Support Vector Machine is employed in this suggested methodology to break down the misjudgements made by the setup models. Precision, recall, f-measure, and accuracy will be graded. As a result, this technology will be applied to many complicated medical information for sickness detection.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is one of worldwide medical challenges with high morbidity and death rate. Since there is no symptom during the early stages of CKD, patients often fail to diagnose the disease. Patients with HIV have more chances to be affected with CKD in critical condition. Early detection of CKD helps patients to obtain prompt care ald delays the further progression of disease. With the availability of pathology data, the use of machine-learning techniques in healthcare for classification and prediction of disease has become more common. This paper presents the classification of CKD using machine learning models. Based on the glomerular filtration rate, the CKD stages are also calculated for patients diagnosed with CKD. DNN model outperforms with 99% of accuracy in classifying CKD patients with HIV.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) often referred to as chronic kidney failure considered to be life threatening disease due to huge deposition of electrolytes, fluids and waste in our body. There is a huge need to differentiate non chronic disease (NCKD) from CKD to recognize the health status of any subject visiting the nephrology clinics. This study makes use of artificial neural network (ANN) based classification of CKD and NCKD. Four attributes, Creatinine, Urea, Sodium and potassium were considered to diagnose the patient suffering from CKD or not. Datasets collected from local general hospital with n=230 was used. A feedforward back propagation neural network (BPNN) model was employed for classification and the performance of BPNN classifier was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity and classification accuracy. The Datasets was initially mined using clustering to decide the valid attribute values. The simulation results shows an overall classification accuracy 95.3% to distinguish subject suffering with CKD from NCKD.

AB  - chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a diagnosis that occurred in kidney which is also called as chronic renal disease. Chronic Kidney Disease means that if a person is suffering from CKD, then that person's kidney is not functioning properly since itcould be damaged and cannot purify the blood as like the normal kidney. Chronic kidney disease has become a common disease in most of the countries and there is no cure for this disease if itprogresses to its final's stages. The only way to live is to rely ondialysis or kidney transplantation but these processes require more time, and it is costly. So, to overcome these problems machine learning techniques are used to diagnosis the disease on time. In this paper we have used four machine learning algorithms which are Support vector machine classifier (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm (KNN), Random Forest algorithm and lastly decision tree algorithm. The dataset used to train these algorithms is taken from UCI repository. Data preprocessing techniques are applied to the dataset so that after training these algorithms the accuracy in predicting CKD increases.

AB  - In the present work a Cuckoo Search (CS) trained Neural Network (NN) or NN-CS based model has been proposed to detect Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) which has become one of the newest threats to the developing and undeveloped countries. Studies and surveys in different parts of India have suggested that CKD is becoming a major concern day by day. The financial burden of the treatment and future consequences of CKD could be unaffordable to many if not detected at an earlier stage. Motivated by this, the NN-CS model has been proposed which significantly overcomes the problem of using local search based learning algorithms to train NNs. The input weight vector of the NN is gradually optimized by using CS to train the NN. The model has been compared with well-known classifiers like Multilayer Perceptron Feedforward Network (MLP-FFN) (trained with scaled conjugate gradient descent) and also with NN supported by Genetic Algorithm (NN-GA). The performance of the classifiers has been measured in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F-Measure. The experimental results suggest that NN-CS based model is capable of detecting CKD more efficiently than any other existing model.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease or CKD is one of the most widespread Kidney diseases that affect people on a larger scale. It gives rise to other biological problems like weak bones, anemia, nerve damage, high blood pressure and can even lead to complete kidney failure. Millions of deaths are caused each year because of CKD. The diagnosis of CKD is a problematic job as there is no major symptom that serves a classification feature in detecting this disease. This paper proposes a Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier that uses a fully connected Deep Neural Network to predict whether a patient suffers from the problem of CKD or not. The model is trained on a dataset of around 400 patients and considers various symptoms like blood pressure, age, sugar level, red blood cell count, etc. that assist the model in performing accurate classification. Our experimental results show that the proposed model can perform classification with the testing accuracy of 92.5&, surpassing the scores achieved by SVM and Naïve Bayes Classifier.

AB  - CKD is a serious reason of demise and disability. It was the 27th focal reason in 1990 and became 18th focal reason in 2010. Near about 1 million people lose their life in 2013. In spite of that, people of developing countries are being affected by CKD. We analyzed the data of CKD patient and proposed a system from which it will be possible to predict the risk of CKD. We have used 455 patients' data. Online data set which is collected from UCI Machine Learning Repository and real time dataset which is collected from Khulna City Medical College are used here. We used Python as a high-level interpreted programming language for developing our system. We trained the data using 10-fold CV and applied Random forest and ANN. The accuracy achieved by Random forest algorithm is 97.12% and ANN is 94.5%. This system will help to predict early disclosure of chronic kidney diseases.

AB  - A staggering 63,538 cases have been registered according to India's health statistics on Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). The average age of nephropathy for humans lies between 48-70 years. CKD is more prevalent among males than females. Bitterly, India ranks among top 17 countries in CKD since 2015, which is characterized by a gradual loss of excretory organ performance over time. Earlier detection of the illness followed by treatment could keep this dreaded disease at the shore. Machine Learning, is making sensible applications in the areas such as analyzing medical science outcomes, sleuthing fraud etc. For the prediction of chronic diseases various machine learning algorithms are implemented.Our main aim is to differentiate the performance of various machine learning algorithms that are primarily based on its accuracy. This research work has idolized Rcode to compare their performance. The pivotal purpose of this study is to analyze the Chronic Kidney Disease dataset and conduct CKD and Non CKD classification cases.

AB  - Calculation of dose of haemodialysis using blood-based modelling is subject to controversies as it is based on unrealistic assumptions. This paper proposes the use of dialysate-based modelling by SVMs to calculate the delivered dose of dialysis. The authors use the solute removal index (SRI), which is correlated to the amount of urea removed, for calculating the dose. The SVM model was trained to recognise the evolution of weight, blood urea nitrogen concentration and solute removal index with respect to time and then used to predict the solute removal index. When the estimated SRI values were compared to the actual SRI values determined by the standard method, the prediction errors were small. This paper is the first demonstration that SVM regression can predict delivered dose of haemodialysis with a clinically acceptable accuracy. The result is an effective technique that will offer the physician a better guide to the monitoring and prescription of haemodialysis therapy thereby reducing the mortality rate among patients.

AB  - Telepathology, which was first used in the 1960s, established the possibility of data exchange and communication for diagnostic evaluation. Human kidney biopsies done on individuals with primary renal failure are the major source of benign renal histopathology data. Most AI applications are still in the conceptual design phase. From computer vision to genomic data gathering, deep learning models are progressively have been used to analyze biological data. Initiatives such as CNN, FCNN, GAN deep hierarchical learning, and recurrent neural networks seem to be well. Over the next five years, the biomedicine material is expected to quadruple every 18–24 months. Going to follow the coronavirus pandemic, digitalization of treatments to intensify, especially in those societies that are always heavily reliant on technology, With Rising numbers of biopsies, data held in archives throughout the world are hardly digitized, and metadata is not standardized. To make matters harder, the development of robust algorithms that are sensitive to inter-laboratory differences necessitates the use of multicenter samples. In biology and wellness, ethical norms and data safeguards that do not endanger patient value are badly required. The kidney domain lags below most fields in terms of big data use in studies. This void, on the other hand, presents a chance for experts to pursue a career in nephrology and have a substantial impact on the discipline.

AB  - Within the recent two decades, chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become a reached global threat. In Sri Lanka, CKD is one of the severe health problems because of the rapid development of CKD of unknown etiology (CKDu) in agricultural zones. Agrochemical and toxic metal contaminations of soil and water, quality of the drinking water, and fluoride level of soil are etiologies for the increase CKDu patients within the farming areas. Early detection of the disease form of the CKD (including CKDu) is critical to prevent and manage the disease and its etiologies. Therefore, this paper introduces an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to determine the CKD form based on the physicochemical parameters of the soil in farming areas. The results of the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) ANN model have been compared with the Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on the model accuracy, precision, recall, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). According to findings, the ANN model presents the best classification and prediction performance for determining the form of the disease.

AB  - The massive amount of data collected by healthcare sector can be effective for analysis, diagnosis and decision making if it is mined properly. Hidden information extracted from the voluminous data can provide help and remedy to handle critical healthcare situations. Chronic kidney disease is a fatal illness of kidney which can be prevented with early correct predictions and proper precautions. Data mining of the information collected from previously diagnosed patients opened up a new phase of medical advancement. However, specific techniques must be executed to accomplish better consequence. In this manuscript the capability of the classification of Support Vector Machine, Decision tree, Naïve Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm, in analyzing the Chronic Kidney Disease dataset collected from UCI repository, was investigated to predict the presence of kidney disease. Data set has been analyzed in terms of accuracy, Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error and Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. In the present study, Decision tree shows promising results when implemented through WEKA data mining tool. Ranking algorithm provides vital improvements in classifications with proper number attributes. 15 proves to be the magic number for selecting attributes for the given dataset resulting highest percent of improvement in accuracy.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is considered as kidney damage which lasts longer than three months. In Sri Lanka, CKD has become a severe problem in the present days due to CKD of unknown aetiology (CKDu) that can be seen popularly in North Central Province. Identifying CKD in the initial stage is important to provide necessary treatments to prevent or cure the disease. In this work main focus is on predicting the patient's status of CKD or non CKD. To predict the value in machine learning classification algorithms have been used. Classification models have been built with different classification algorithms will predict the CKD and non CKD status of the patient. These models have applied on recently collected CKD dataset downloaded from the UCI repository with 400 data records and 25 attributes. Results of different models are compared. From the comparison it has been observed that the model with Multiclass Decision forest algorithm performed best with an accuracy of 99.1% for the reduced dataset with the 14 attributes.

AB  - Chronic Renal Failure (CRF) is one of the major disease which affect the human life. The stages of CRF start with loss of renal functions and gradually it leads to complete failure of all kidney functions. This disease is fatal at its end stage unless a replacement of kidney or a dialysis process which is an artificial filtering mechanism is not done. So an early prediction of disease is very important to save the human life. Machine learning is a part of artificial intelligence that uses a variety of techniques to learn from complex dataset. Machine learning techniques are widely used in medical field for disease prediction and prognosis. The objective of this work is to develop a clinical decision support system using machine learning techniques. In this paper first the classification techniques like neural network based back propagation (BPN), probability based Naive Bayes, LDA classifier, lazy learner K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), tree based decision tree, and Random subspace classification algorithms are analyzed. The accuracy of each algorithm found is 81.5%, 78%, 76%, 90%, 93% and 94% respectively on a dataset collected from UCI repository which contains 25 attributes and 400 instances. From the results obtained, the algorithm which gave better result was used for the developing the Clinical Decision Support System.

AB  - This paper implies an investigative approach to study the performance of different boosting algorithms in predicting chronic kidney disease (CKD) more accurately. In recent years, CKD has reached a global prevalence with much severity which can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) if not detected early. Various boosting machine learning algorithms have been proven to be an effective tool to detect CKD in its initial stages. The dataset of the University of California, Irvine (UCI) repository has been utilized to train and test the model classifier containing 25 attributes. However, four different data frames were constructed by four different strategies (mean, median, mode, and null dropping method) to facilitate the missing values in the dataset. Eventually, three boosting algorithms were studied and corresponding confusion matrices are portrayed. Hence, a broad comparative investigation was conducted in terms of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1 score, ROC-AUC of each algorithm. Maximum accuracy of 99.75% was observed in the case of AdaBoost and LightGBM algorithms while 99.5% accuracy was noticed for XGBoost.

AB  - In today's world, technological developments have an huge impact on medicine (health sector) as well as every branch of science. Importance of data analysis made by technology in medicine is increasing day by day. Thanks to the technology, the health care workers' decisions are more accurate and successful treatments can be applied on the patient. In this study, chronic renal disease was analyzed relying on the patient's laboratory results and patient's background. The data set used in the study is the chronic kidney disease data set taken in the UCI machine learning data warehouse. In the chronic kidney dataset, the Bayesian classification algorithm, which is obtained from the laboratory results of 400 patients, was compared with the classification algorithm of K-nn neighbors (k-nn) classification and Support Vector Machines classification algorithms. Data preprocessing steps such as completion of the missing data and normalization of the data on this data set have been performed. In addition, before moving on to the classification algorithms for the estimation work, the feature selection was applied to select which of the attributes are more important and which will affect the performance of the classification result. Feature selection process is carried out by using Relief and Gain Ratio algorithms for attribute selection. It has been proved that the raw data of the chronic renal disease gives the best performance in the classification algorithm with k nearest neighbor algorithm after the feature selection with Relief algorithm. As a performance evaluation criterion of the models, from the contrast matrix; accuracy, precision, sensitivity and F-measure values were used. 10 sets of cross validation method was used for the data set as test and training set.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is heterogeneous disorders that affects the renal functions and structures of millions of people around the globe, and it is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Given the circumstances, several studies had been conducted in order to detect CKD at an early stage. However, each of these studies has its own set of limitations such as the failure to employ proper methods for coping with missing values, anomalies, and class imbalance problems, overfitting issues, and so on. Taking into account the shortcomings that recent research has uncovered, we propose a novel CKD diagnosis method based on 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) that overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks while also significantly improving diagnosis accuracy. The Chronic Kidney Diseases Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository has been used in this study. MissForest imputation, a precise non-parametric missing value imputation process, has been used to handle missing data. Additionally, memory-efficient Isolation Forest has been applied to deal with anomalies. After evaluating the model with chronic kidney disease dataset, our proposed model achieved 99.21 % accuracy which is better than the state of the art method.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health problem with high morbidity and mortality rate, and it induces other diseases. Since there are no obvious symptoms during the early stages of CKD, patients often fail to notice the disease. Early detection of CKD enables patients to receive timely treatment to ameliorate the progression of this disease. Machine learning models can effectively aid clinicians achieve this goal due to their fast and accurate recognition performance. In this study, we propose a machine learning methodology for diagnosing CKD. The CKD data set was obtained from the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository, which has a large number of missing values. KNN imputation was used to fill in the missing values, which selects several complete samples with the most similar measurements to process the missing data for each incomplete sample. Missing values are usually seen in real-life medical situations because patients may miss some measurements for various reasons. After effectively filling out the incomplete data set, six machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes classifier and feed forward neural network) were used to establish models. Among these machine learning models, random forest achieved the best performance with 99.75% diagnosis accuracy. By analyzing the misjudgments generated by the established models, we proposed an integrated model that combines logistic regression and random forest by using perceptron, which could achieve an average accuracy of 99.83% after ten times of simulation. Hence, we speculated that this methodology could be applicable to more complicated clinical data for disease diagnosis.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is one of the deadliest diseases that slowly damages human kidney. The disease remains undetected in its early stage and the patients can only realize the severity of the disease when it gets advanced. Hence, detecting such disease at earlier stage is a key challenge now. Data mining is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that is widely used to derive interesting patterns from a large volume of medical data. While various data mining techniques used by Experts, boosting and rule extraction techniques have rarely been applied in analyzing Kidney diseases. Boosting is a method of ensemble technique that enhances the prediction power of a data mining model. AdaBoost and LogitBoost are used here for comparing the performance of classification. Ant-Miner is also a data mining algorithm that applies Ant Colony Optimization technique. Ant-Miner along with Decision tree have been used in the paper to derive rules. The aim of this paper is two-fold: analyzing the performance of boosting algorithms for detecting CKD and deriving rules illustrating relationship among the attributes of CKD. The best information retrieved by both classification and rule generation techniques are promising and can be adopted by the Medical Scientists for their research purpose.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease is one of the most critical illness nowadays and proper diagnosis is required as soon as possible. Machine learning technique has become reliable for medical treatment. With the help of a machine learning classifier algorithms, the doctor can detect the disease on time. For this perspective, Chronic Kidney Disease prediction has been discussed in this article. Chronic Kidney Disease dataset has been taken from the UCI repository. Seven classifier algorithms have been applied in this research such as artificial neural network, C5.0, Chi-square Automatic interaction detector, logistic regression, linear support vector machine with penalty L1 & with penalty L2 and random tree. The important feature selection technique was also applied to the dataset. For each classifier, the results have been computed based on (i) full features, (ii) correlation-based feature selection, (iii) Wrapper method feature selection, (iv) Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, (v) synthetic minority over-sampling technique with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression selected features, (vi) synthetic minority over-sampling technique with full features. From the results, it is marked that LSVM with penalty L2 is giving the highest accuracy of 98.86% in synthetic minority over-sampling technique with full features. Along with accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, area under the curve and GINI coefficient have been computed and compared results of various algorithms have been shown in the graph. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression selected features with synthetic minority over-sampling technique gave the best after synthetic minority over-sampling technique with full features. In the synthetic minority over-sampling technique with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator selected features, again linear support vector machine gave the highest accuracy of 98.46%. Along with machine learning models one deep neural network has been applied on the same dataset and it has been noted that deep neural network achieved the highest accuracy of 99.6%.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD), also known as chronic renal disease, which is progressive loss in kidney function over a period of months or years. It is defined by the presence of kidney damage or decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The estimated prevalence of CKD is about 9-13% in the general adult population. Individuals with CKD have a far greater likelihood of cardiovascular death than progression to end-stage renal disease. CKD is more prevalent in patients with CVD or with CVD related risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome In proposed work, we are not only extracting action rules based on stages but also predicting CKD by using naïve bayes with OneR attribute selector which helps to prevent the advancing of chronic renal disease to further stages.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a serious lifelong ailment caused kidney malfunction. To diagnose CKD, number of EHRs generated and manually process them is difficult. So, to process these EHRs and to diagnose CKD Machine learning approaches can assist. The main motive of this study is to use machine learning algorithms to diagnose CKD in order to assist people to avoid it. The CKD Dataset acquired from the UCI machine learning repository is analyzed using machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), and Logistic Regression (LR). WEKA v3.8.3 was used to conduct the experiment. The mean of the values was used to replace missing values. With 99 % accuracy, RF outperforms other approaches. Against the CKD dataset, the ROC curves of LR and ANN yielded 0.999 and 0.998 results, respectively. This research can assist healthcare institutions and researchers in predicting CKD at an early stage.

AB  - This manuscript aims to develop a framework to deliver the prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) for a patient using the Machine Learning technique. The performance of five individual Machine Learning classifiers is analyzed for the purpose of clarifying the performance measures of CKD. According to average classification accuracy, precision, recall, and fl score, the decisions are estimated along with the ROC AUC score. For this investigation, Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest classifiers are applied as distinct classifiers. In order to increase and stabilize the performance metrics of the classifiers, necessary data preprocessing is carried out on the CKD dataset. Observation of the corresponding performance metrics indicates that Random Forest has outperformed all the other classifiers by producing an accuracy score of 93.4% and ROC AUC of 94.4% before data preprocessing and an accuracy score of 95.6% and ROC AUC of 96.2% after necessary data preprocessing.

AB  - Medical ultrasound (US) imaging is an important tool for the clinical diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Since the interpretation of US images highly depends on the subjective experience of clinicians, artificial intelligence (AI) using convolutional neural networks (CNN) has been widely adopted to assist clinicians to improve their diagnoses. In this study, we retrospectively collected the renal US images and biopsy pathology reports in the past ten years from three hospitals affiliated with Taipei Medical University to realize the prediction of the stage of renal interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) by AI-assisted interpretation of US images. We will first input the renal US images into the Mask R-CNN model for ROI extraction with Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice coefficient as quantitative metrics. Then, the proposed dual-path convolutional neural network (DPCNN) is used to simultaneously extract and integrate high-level and low-level features in the US image for IFTA prediction. With five-fold cross-validation, the proposed DPCNN for binary IFTA classification of non-diabetic nephropathy achieves the accuracy of 0.856 (0.818-0.876), the recall of 0.761 (0.715-0.817), the specificity of 0.927 (0.862-0.952), the precision of 0.887 (0.804-0.920), the F1 score of 0.819 (0.776-0.846) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.922 (0.893-0.944). The results are all significantly better than other existing convolutional neural network models.

AB  - Kidney is the most important organ in a human body. But now-a-days Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is the most common problem for the people. Today good many people die because of Chronic Kidney Disease. This CKD is the most common and a serious disease in the world. The gradual loss of function of a kidney is also called Chronic Kidney Disease. The affected kidney is measured on Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR). If the GFR rate is high, the kidney is in a good condition and if the GFR rate is very low, the kidney is affected. In this paper, we have tried the feature selection method which is used to reduce the attributes and select the more essential attributes only. We can classify the data, using four classifiers namely JRip, SMO, Naive Bayes and IBK. Finally we can compare the results of reduced attribute dataset and original dataset result using these four classifiers. Thus we can find the correct classifier and the best classifier. The classification is the most important part of the processes and it is done using data mining technique based on the machine learning. The classification can be used to predict group membership for data instances.

AB  - Feature Selection is an important precursor to prediction and classification of medical data. Medical data mining is evolving at a faster rate and the current machine learning algorithms need to be imbibed with intelligent prediction and classification systems to handle the huge medical data. Since the huge volume of data stored in the medical database may be prone to `curse of dimensionality', it becomes necessary to adopt methods that handle the issues of high dimensional data and improve the stability of the selected method. One such solution as envisaged in recent literature is the ensemble feature selection technique that combines the results of filter and wrapper methods to select the most discriminatory features for diagnosis of chronic diseases. In this paper, an ensemble feature selection technique is applied to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) dataset. Density based Feature Selection (DFS) method is used as a filter approach to rank the features of CKD. The results of DFS method is given to a wrapper based optimization technique named Improved Teacher Learner Based Optimization (ITLBO) algorithm to find the optimal feature set that contains the most important features for prediction of CKD with high accuracy. The results of ensemble feature selection method are evaluated using SVM, Gradient Boosting, and CNN classification algorithms. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method is able to achieve high classification accuracy of 93% for SVM, 97% for Gradient Boosting and 97.75% for CNN respectively for the derived optimal feature subset.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health burden that affects approximately 10% of the adult population in the world. It is also recognized as the top 20 causes of death worldwide. Unfortunately, there is no cure for CKD however, it is possible to slow down its progression and mollify the damage by early diagnosis of the disease. Due to a limited number of nephrologists, the early diagnosis of CKD is often not possible for most of the people. Therefore the use of modern computer-aided methods is necessary to aid the traditional CKD diagnosis system to be more efficient and accurate. In this research, our primary focus was to apply 3 modern machine learning techniques namely logistic regression, feedforward neural networks and wide & deep learning to diagnose CKD as well as finding the best performing technique by evaluating their diagnosis performance. To evaluate their performance, f1-score, precision, recall and AUC score was used for logistic regression and an additional loss score was considered for the feedforward neural networks and wide & deep model. We found the feedforward neural network as the best performing technique for CKD diagnosis with 0.99 f1-score, 0.97 precision, 0.99 recall and 0.99 AUC score. Logistic regression produced the lowest result among all and the wide & deep learning with a larger number of hidden layers and neurons found to be effective for larger datasets.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a type of chronic disease which means it happens slowly over a period of time and persists for a long time thereafter. It is deadly at its end stage and will only be cured by kidney replacement or regular dialysis which is an artificial filtering mechanism. It is important to identify CKD at the early stage so that necessary treatments can be provided to prevent or cure the disease. The main focus in this paper is on the classification techniques, that is, tree-based decision tree, random forest, and logistic regression has been analyzed. Different measure has been used for comparison between algorithms for the dataset collected from standard UCI repository.

Our work presents a classifier (named ANFIS) in accordance with the notion of neuro-fuzzy in order to detect the existence of chronic kidney disease. We use blood test results of several patients for our research study. We compare our proposed classifier with some conventional classifiers such as Multi-layer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree. Experimental results indicates that our proposed neuro-fuzzy rule-based classifier performs better than the other classifiers used here. ANFIS has given 3% to 4% better accuracy compared to the other classifiers.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) or chronic renal disease has become a major issue with a steady growth rate. A person can only survive without kidneys for an average time of 18 days, which makes a huge demand for a kidney transplant and Dialysis. It is important to have effective methods for early prediction of CKD. Machine learning methods are effective in CKD prediction. This work proposes a workflow to predict CKD status based on clinical data, incorporating data prepossessing, a missing value handling method with collaborative filtering and attributes selection. Out of the 11 machine learning methods considered, the extra tree classifier and random forest classifier are shown to result in the highest accuracy and minimal bias to the attributes. The research also considers the practical aspects of data collection and highlights the importance of incorporating domain knowledge when using machine learning for CKD status prediction.

AB  - Persistent disease is defined as one that develops slowly but remains constant over time. One of the long-term diseases is chronic kidney disease. There are various stages of CKD severity. While therapy has been shown to postpone improvement, it becomes very serious over time, and if not managed properly, CKD can lead to cardiovascular disease in the early stages. If our kidneys aren't working properly, we'll need dialysis or a kidney transplant. The final stage of renal disease is kidney failure, which is treated with dialysis or a kidney transplant. The classification techniques are the main subject of this research, which includes logistic regression, tree-based decision tree, and random forest and analyzed the performance of these techniques.

AB  - Technological developments generally have positive effects on our daily lives especially on health domain. Diagnosing diseases through new machines or methods are easier than compared to the past. Benchmarking the effect of attribute selection methods on the performance of classification algorithms in a study to diganose the chronic kidney disease (CKD) by using classification algorithms are aimed. Data set on CKD taken from the UCI machine learning repository has been used for the experiments. After a variety of pre-processing, normalization and attribute selection processes, classifier models are designed. In order to determine the attributes that have gerater contribution on the classification results, the Correlation Based attribute selection (CBAS) method and Fuzzy Rough Set Based attribute selection (FRSBAS) method were used. Two data sets obtained by each attribute selection method and the raw data are classified by 4 classifiers including k-Nearest Neighbor, Navie Bayes, Random Forest and Logistic Regression. The test and training data are separated by 5-fold cross validation. The accuracy, precision, sensitivity, ROC curve and F-measure parameters obtained from confusion matrix are used to compare and evaluate the results of the models. As a result of the study, it is seen that the application of FRSBAS method on CKD data set performs better in all classification algorithms.

AB  - Early diagnosis and characterization are the important components in determining the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD is an ailment which tends to damage the kidney and affect their effective functioning of excreting waste and balancing body fluids. Some of the complications included are hypertension, anemia (low blood count), mineral bone disorder, poor nutritional health, acid base abnormalities, and neurological complications. Early and error-free detection of CKD can be helpful in averting further deterioration of patient's health. These chronic diseases are prognosticated using various types of data mining classification approaches and machine learning (ML) algorithms. This Prediction is performed using Random Forest (RF) Classifier, Logistic Regression (LR) and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The data used is collected from the UCI Repository with 400 data sets with 25 attributes. This data has been fed into Classification algorithms. The experimental results show that K-NN, LR, SVM hands out an accuracy of 94%, 98% and 93.75% respectively. The RF classifier gives out a maximum accuracy of 100%

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major public health concern with rising prevalence. In Saudi Arabia, approximately 2 Billion Riyals are solely allocated for renal replacement therapy which is required for patients with advanced stages of CKD. Therefore, this study aims to decrease the number of patients and the expenses needed for treatment by preemptively diagnosing chronic kidney disease accurately using data mining and machine learning techniques. Data have been collected from a region that has never been explored before in literature. This study uses Saudi data retrieved from King Fahd University Hospital(KFUH) in Khobar to carry out the experiment. Experimental Results show that ANN, SVM, Naïve Bayes achieved a testing accuracy of 98.0% while k-NN has achieved an accuracy of 93.9%.

AB  - Kidney Damage is otherwise known as Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) which is a common term for various heterogeneous diseases in the kidneys. There are many cases with an imprecise diagnosis and extensively organized medical procedures may lead to many difficulties in the patient health. Hence, it is advisable to go for early diagnosis and prediction of kidney disease. The main aim of this research is to predict whether the patient is affected with CKD or not whereas the Machine Learning (ML) classification algorithms have been utilized to predict the value. The patient with CKD and non-CKD status can be predicted using various classification algorithms. This survey has discussed about various ML algorithms which utilized to diagnose kidney disease as well as the significant issues are explained briefly. Hence, this review about current study of ML applications in kidney disease is well recognized by clinicians and greatly enhances the clinical practice in future.

AB  - Chronic renal disease (CRD), also known as chronic kidney disease, is affecting an ever-increasing number of people. This trend is expected to continue (CKD). The majority of people get concerned about their health when they first notice symptoms, but when they become concerned, they are more likely to take action. Because the life expectancy of a person without a kidney is just approximately 18 days on average, people are increasingly turning to dialysis and kidney transplants to extend their lives. Because of its lack of indicators, or even total absence of symptoms in some cases, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is notoriously difficult to detect and treat in its early stages. Learning by machine is now the most accurate way for diagnosing and forecasting these conditions, which offers some reason for optimism towards the future. The use of machine learning algorithms is quite effective in forecasting the start of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Using data from Decision Trees, SVMs, KNN, Random Forest, and other machine learning methods, along with 400 patient samples from CKD patients. This study suggests a method for determining a patient's likelihood of developing chronic kidney disease by analysing the patient's health records. The process begins with the preparation of the data, followed by the identification of a method for dealing with missing values, collaborative filtering, and attribute selection. Random forests, decision trees, and K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers all came out on top in terms of accuracy and bias when compared to the other machine learning strategies that were investigated in this study [11]. For the purpose of ensuring that machine learning can effectively detect the existence of chronic kidney disease, this study also includes the inclusion of more practical components such as data gathering and domain expertise.

AB  - Detection of disease at earlier stages is the most challenging one. Datasets of different diseases are available online with different number of features corresponding to a particular disease. Many dimensionality reduction and feature extraction techniques are used nowadays to reduce the number of features in dataset and finding the most appropriate ones. This paper explores the difference in performance of different machine learning models using Principal Component Analysis dimensionality reduction technique on the datasets of Chronic kidney disease and Cardiovascular disease. Further, the authors apply Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbour, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest Model on the datasets and compare the performance of the model with and without PCA. A key challenge in the field of data mining and machine learning is building accurate and computationally efficient classifiers for medical applications. With an accuracy of 100% in chronic kidney disease and 85% for heart disease, KNN classifier and logistic regression were revealed to be the most optimal method of predictions for kidney and heart disease respectively.

AB  - Kidneys are the filter of the human body. About 10% of the global population is thought to be affected by Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which causes kidney function to decline. To protect in danger patients from additional kidney damage, effective risk evaluation of CKD and appropriate CKD monitoring are crucial. Due to quick and precise detection capabilities, Machine Learning models can help practitioners accomplish this goal efficiently therefore an enormous number of diagnosis systems and processes in the healthcare sector nowadays are relying on machine learning due to its disease prediction capability. In this study, we designed and suggested disease predictive computer-aided designs for the diagnosis of CKD. The dataset for CKD is attained from the repository of machine learning of UCL, with a few missing values; those are filled in using “mean/mode” and “Random sampling method” strategies. After successfully achieving the missing data, eight ML techniques (Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XG _Boost, Decision Tree and AdaBoost) were used to establish models and the performance evaluation comparisons among the result accuracies are measured by the techniques to find the machine learning models with highest accuracies. Among them, Random Forest as well as Logistic Regression showed an outstanding 99% accuracy, followed by the Ada Boost, XG-Boost, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and SVM whereas the KNN classifier model stands last with an accuracy of 73%.

AU  - P. Yildirim

AB  - Imbalanced data is an important problem for medical data analysis. Medical datasets are often not balanced in their class labels. The traditional classifiers can be seriously affected by the imbalanced class distribution in the data. This is because they aim to optimize the overall accuracy without considering the relative distribution of each class. This study searches the effect of class imbalance in training data when developing neural network classifier for medical decision making on chronic kidney disease. Neural networks are widely used in a number of applications including data mining and decision systems. Back propagation networks are a popular type of neural networks that can be trained to recognize different patterns. The importance of these networks was considered and a comparative study of some sampling algorithms was performed based on multilayer perceptron with different learning rate values for the prediction of chronic kidney disease. This study reveals that sampling algorithms can improve the performance of classification algorithms and learning rate is a crucial parameter which can significantly effect on multilayer perceptron.

AB  - The most critical problem in the health community is the detection of kidney disease. In developing countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and India either the government hospitals do not have enough facilities or private health centers are too expensive to give medical care for kidney patients. The primary objective of this research is to detect kidney disease at an early stage. A solution found on statistical analysis and machine learning, to predict renal failure is proposed. Sample data of 800 patients having an age group limit of 20-60 years are collected through a questionnaire from different hospitals in Punjab, Pakistan. A questionnaire has been designed to obtain a variety of data such as gender, age, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, ESRD, eGFR rate, smoking, swelling of feet or ankles, anemia, insomnia, and kidney stones, etc. The contributions of this paper include different pre-processing techniques, including data normalization. Multiple machine learning algorithms were applied, including Decision Tree, KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor), SVC (Support vector Classifier) Neural Network, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest. Random forest, SVC, Decision tree, and Naive Bayes gives the accuracy of 96%, 91%, 93%, and 97%, respectively. Neural Network gives the best results with 98%accuracy.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease is considered a major health concern because of the increased risk of illness and mortality. As kidney infections are slow and chronic, they are more difficult to diagnose. This is the same reason why many patients are unable to make a diagnosis until the final stage. It is important to have reliable techniques to assess CKD at an early stage. In disease diagnosis and early-stage diagnosis, machine learning approaches play an essential role. The main objective of this project is to assess the risk phase of CKD. To determine the risk stage, this model is developed using classification techniques that are employed as meta classifiers. To complete the task, the technique is divided into various parts. In the first module, the traditional data is pre-processed. Label encoding and standard scalar are the techniques that are used to compute pre-processing. Base classifiers like KNN and Random Forest are used, Extra tree classifiers are used as meta classifiers to process the information. Therefore, the risk stage of kidney infection is known.

AB  - This research was conducted with the goals of developing models that have an accurate classification of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and locating significant prognostic factors within a clinical dataset. In chronic kidney disease, accurate classification and identification of major risk factors contribute to improved prognoses and provide assistance to nephrologists. The data source is not balanced enough to serve as a benchmark for any machine learning or deep learning models due to privacy concerns and other factors. As a result, it is difficult to achieve consistent accuracy with an imbalanced dataset, and there will be a variance in results with various machine learning models due to the fact that there are so many different factors involved. A multiple-level ensemble learning system was utilised in the proposed research in order to classify chronic kidney disease using a hybrid synthesised dataset. A hybrid synthesised dataset is one that contains both the original dataset as well as the synthesised data that was produced using the ADASYN method. The most important risk factors for chronic kidney disease are accounted for in the model that was proposed. The F1-score and accuracy were two of the metrics that were utilised in this research. Furthermore, the plot demonstrates that the multilevel ensemble is superior to the conventional machine learning techniques in terms of consistency and accuracy. The variance was calculated using the proposed model by iterating for a total of 150 times, which is a significant reduction when compared to multi-level ensemble techniques using hybrid preprocessed datasets. The accuracy of classifying patients with chronic kidney disease was significantly improved by using a multi-level ensemble. These models and parameters highlight the significance of current health status information in estimating the likelihood of developing kidney disease as well as its progression.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease is one among the non-contagious illnesses that affect most of the individual in the world. The main factors of risk for the Chronic Kidney Disease are Diabetes, Heart Ailment, Hypertension. The Chronic Kidney Disease shows no symptoms in the early stages and most of the cases are diagnosed in the advanced stage. This leads to delayed treatment to the patient which may be fatal. Machine learning technique provides an efficient way in the prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease at the earliest stage. In this paper, four ensemble algorithms are used to diagnose the patient with Chronic Kidney Disease at the earlier stages. The machine learning models are evaluated based on seven performance metrics including Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, F1-Score, and Mathew Correlation Coefficient. Based on the evaluation the AdaBoost and Random Forest performed the best in terms of accuracy, precision, Sensitivity compared to Gradient Boosting and Bagging. The AdaBoost and Random Forest also showed the Mathew Correlation Coefficient and Area Under the curve scores of 100%. The machine learning model proposed in this paper will provide an efficient way to prevent Chronic Kidney diseases by enabling the medical practitioners to diagnose the disease at an early stage.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a disease caused by degeneration function of the kidneys. CKD is top ten leading causes of death in the world. There are two leading causes of CKD, i.e. diabetes and hypertension. When the symptoms become more severe, the disease can only be treated with dialysis and kidney transplantation. This disease can be treated if the diagnose is conducted appropriately and quickly. However, the signs and symptoms are often not specific. Because of that, diagnosis from medical personnel is may subjective and vary. This study developed machine learning method using ensemble learning and feature selection to improve the quality of CKD diagnosis. The CKD dataset was taken from UCI machine learning repository, it contain 400 instances. CKD dataset have 24 attributes including signs, symptoms and risk factors that might appear due to CKD. In this study, features were selected using a Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) and AdaBoost was used for ensemble learning to improve the detection of CKD. K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm (kNN), Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used as base classifier. Overall, the best result was achieved by combination of kNN classifier with CFS and AdaBoost, with 0.981 accuracy rate, 0.980 recall rate and 0.980 f-measure rate. Highest precision rate was achieved by the combination of Naive Bayes classifier with CFS and AdaBoost, with 0.981 precision rate.

AB  - The severity of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing around the world especially for low-income countries where testing and prediction could be based on several medical comorbidities. This could require advanced equipment and expertise which might not be available during regular medical examinations. To quickly predict the severity of CKD using the least subset of easily available blood biochemical features at certain threshold values during medical examinations, we developed and compared several machine learning classification and clustering models as well as a neural network approach. The clinical and blood biochemical results from a chronic disease data set from Kaggle.com consisting of 24 dimensions of various cardinal features used in determining chronic kidney disease and 400 samples was utilized for this project. Seven predictive and classification models were established including Random Forest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Xgboost, Decision Tree, Neural networks, and Naïve Bayes. Three clustering algorithms including Fuzzy c-means, hard k-means, and self-organizing maps (SOMs) were also established. The accuracy, sensitivity (recall), precision, f1 score and 10-folds cross validation results for all models were evaluated, and the outcomes were ranked and analyzed. Decision tree (DT) was used to produce the highest classification accuracy of 98.8% and a 10-fold cross validation value of 95.75%. SOMs produced the best clustering results ahead of K-means and FCM with accuracy of 85.0% and F1_score of 84.2%. In addition, minimum threshold values which could trigger CKD in patients were determined. The neural network model was able to predict CKD with 85.0% accuracy, precision of 83.0%, recall of 84.3, fi score of 83.8% and a 10-fold validation accuracy of 84.5%. Lastly, we used SOM to obtain unique CKD clusters with common features among four unique clusters which caused chronic kidney disease.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a concerning health issue worldwide as it affects a huge population with a high mortality rate. CKD patients are at increased risk of developing adverse effects such as anemia, bone diseases, cardiac disorders and hormonal problems. Since the loss of renal function occurs gradually and its symptoms are devoid, advanced technologies are needed to find the patterns and relationships in medical data for early diagnosis. This work aims to focus on detecting CKD from clinical data using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and comparing their findings with various machine learning algorithms. As the data available has some missing values, numerical data are imputed using k-nearest neighbor and categorical data are imputed with the most frequently occurring category. Hence, this article exposes the best method to automatically diagnose CKD from clinical data. The empirical results indicated that CNN outperforms other classifiers, with a promising accuracy of 99.12%.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) acts as one of the commonly occurring problem that causes death globally. The increasing scale of CKD patients created the need for finding the early prediction systems and solutions. Due to large dataset and recorded information of patients, the processing time is high and scaling the dataset in the initial stage is highlighted. The presented study is focused on the foremost problem of kidney disease prediction in the early stages using a robust machine learning algorithm. The proposed work is modeled with Hybrid CatBoost algorithm in which the iterative learning process enables the system to adjust the weight of the training pattern; hence an effective prediction is made. The system is used to make the initial correlation factor between the training vector and testing vector of the CKD patient’s data. Higher the learning rate, better the prediction accuracy. The proposed system is validated through a number of quantitative measures such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1Score.

AB  - An accurate estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is clinically crucial for kidney disease diagnosis and predicting the prognosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Machine learning methodologies such as deep neural networks provide a potential avenue for increasing accuracy in GFR estimation. We developed a novel deep learning architecture, a deep and shallow neural network, to estimate GFR (dlGFR for short) and examined its comparative performance with estimated GFR from Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations. The dlGFR model jointly trains a shallow learning model and a deep neural network to enable both linear transformation from input features to a log GFR target, and non-linear feature embedding for stage of kidney function classification. We validate the proposed methods on the data from multiple studies obtained from the NIDDK Central Database Repository. The deep learning model predicted values of GFR within 30% of measured GFR with 88.3% accuracy, compared to the 87.1% and 84.7% of the accuracy achieved by CKD-EPI and MDRD equations (p = 0.051 and p < 0.001, respectively). Our results suggest that deep learning methods are superior to equations resulting from traditional statistical methods in estimating glomerular filtration rate. Based on these results, an end-to-end predication system has been deployed to facilitate use of the proposed dlGFR algorithm.

AU  - P. A. Moreno-Sanchez

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a worldwide chronic disease that, if it is recognized late, leads a vast majority of patients to suffer premature mortality and quality of life decline due to a progressive loss of kidney function. Data mining classifiers would contribute to an early diagnosis and hence preventing kidney severe damage since subtle patterns in CKD indicators can be discovered. By employing Cross Industry Standard Process of Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology along with features importance techniques, this work develops a classifier model that would support healthcare professionals in early diagnosis of CKD patients. By means of a data workflow pipeline, an automated data transformation, modelling and evaluation is applied to the CKD dataset extracted from the University of California Irvine-Machine Learning (UCI-ML) repository. The pipeline developed is used to carry out an exhaustive search of the best data mining classifier and the different parameters of the data preparation's sub-stages like data missing and feature selection. As a result, AdaBoost is selected as the best classifier with a 100% in terms of accuracy, precision, sensivity, specificity, and f1-score; outperforming the classification results obtained by the related works even with unseen data from a test set. Regarding model's interpretability, the application of feature selection reduces from 24 to 12 the group of features to be employed in the classifier model developed, achieving more explainable model's outputs. Furthermore, an analysis of the importance of features selected is carried out to explore the relevance of each selected feature.

AB  - This paper presents a neural network-based classifier to predict whether a person is at risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD). The model is trained with the demographic data and medical care information of two population groups: on the one hand, people diagnosed with CKD in Colombia during 2018, and on the other, a sample of people without a diagnosis of this disease. Once the model is trained and evaluation metrics for classification algorithms are applied, the model achieves 95% accuracy in the test data set, making its application for disease prognosis feasible. However, despite the demonstrated efficiency of the neural networks to predict CKD, this machine-learning paradigm is opaque to the expert regarding the explanation of the outcome. Current research on eXplainable AI proposes the use of twin systems, where a black-box machine-learning method is complemented by another white-box method that provides explanations about the predicted values. Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) has proved to be an ideal complement as this paradigm is able to find explanatory cases for an explanation-by-example justification of a neural network's prediction. In this paper, we apply and validate a NN-CBR twin system for the explanation of CKD predictions. As a result of this research, 3,494,516 people were identified as being at risk of developing CKD in Colombia, or 7% of the total population.

AB  - The main objective of this work is to investigate the performance of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models while applying to the survivability prediction on Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients. Chronic kidney disease patients suffer from losing the primary function of the kidney, i.e., blood filtration, gradually over time. At the end stage, regular hemodialysis or kidney transplant are required to survive. During the process of disease development, patients may also suffer from complications of acidosis, anemia, diabetes, high blood pressure or neuropathy, etc., which in turn affects patients' quotidian life. It is reported that the median survival time of late-stage patients is only about 3 years. Evaluating precisely the condition of patients is of great importance as it would greatly help to decide appropriate care, medications or medical interventions needed, which among them have a complex interrelationship and influence the outcome of the individual patient. An accurate prediction model would hopefully be able to fit into that role and may be used to revise current treatment. However, due to the complex nature of the problem, as multiple interrelated factors may influence the patient's survival, finding such a model is a challenging task. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI), especially the deep learning technique has become a thriving field, owing to the rise of computational capability. As the approach needs no human specialist in specifying explicit knowledge in advance, but gathers knowledge automatically from amounts of data by building a hierarchy of concepts with complicated ones upon simpler ones, it has already been applied successfully in intuitive problems, like understanding speeches or images, making diagnoses in medicine or self-driving cars, etc. And conversely, technological advancements have been made available through practical applications, profiting from which we may develop prediction models for chronic kidney disease survivability. In this research, data preprocessing, data transformations, and artificial neural networks are used to establish the mapping from many clinical factors to the patient's survival. The computational results are also reported in the paper.

AB  - Efficiency of haemodialysis in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is determined by calculating adequacy. The adequacy of dialysis and its measurement have been debated over the past 20 years by authorities concerned about how much of this life-sustaining treatment is appropriate for patients with ESRD. Currently, the minimum dose of dialysis is assessed by computerised calculation of urea kinetics. Although fairly standard, it is still an approximate method due to the various assumptions made in the development of the final parametric model. Until now artificial intelligence has not been used to study haemodialysis and hence no machine learning approach has been used to model it so far. In this paper, an algorithmic approach is presented for this procedure using generalised radial basis function neural networks (GRNNN) and this research has shown it to be very promising.

AB  - Objective: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health concern worldwide. High costs of late-stage diagnosis and insufficient testing facilities can contribute to high morbidity and mortality rates in CKD patients, particularly in less developed countries. Thus, early diagnosis aided by vital parameter analytics using affordable computer-aided diagnosis could not only reduce diagnosis costs but improve patient management and outcomes. Methods: In this study, we developed machine learning models using selective key pathological categories to identify clinical test attributes that will aid in accurate early diagnosis of CKD. Such an approach will save time and costs for diagnostic screening. We have also evaluated the performance of several classifiers with k-fold cross-validation on optimized datasets derived using these selected clinical test attributes. Results: Our results suggest that the optimized datasets with important attributes perform well in diagnosis of CKD using our proposed machine learning models. Furthermore, we evaluated clinical test attributes based on urine and blood tests along with clinical parameters that have low costs of acquisition. The predictive models with the optimized and pathologically categorized attributes set yielded high levels of CKD diagnosis accuracy with random forest (RF) classifier being the best performing. Conclusions: Our machine learning approach has yielded effective predictive analytics for CKD screening which can be developed as a resource to facilitate improved CKD screening for enhanced and timely treatment plans.

AB  - The incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is rising rapidly around the globe. Asymptomatic CKD is common and guideline-directed monitoring to predict CKD by various factors is underutilized. Computer-aided automated diagnostic (CAD) can play a major role to predict CKD. CAD systems such as deep learning algorithms are pivotal in disease diagnosis due to their high classification accuracy. In this paper, various clinical features of CKD were utilized and seven state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms (ANN, LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM, Bidirectional GRU, MLP, and Simple RNN) were implemented for the prediction and classification of CKD. The proposed algorithms were applied based on artificial intelligence by extracting and evaluating features using five different approaches from pre-processed and fitted CKD datasets. In this study, we have measured accuracy, precision, recall, and calculated the loss and validation loss in prediction. Further, the study analyzed computation time and prediction ratio, and AUC to evaluate the model performance along with statistical significance to compare their performances. While classifying CKD, algorithms such as ANN, Simple RNN, and MLP provided high accuracy of 99%, 96%, 97% respectively, and a good prediction ratio along with reduced time. The model outperforms traditional data classification techniques by providing superior predictive ability. Subsequently, the study proposed the integration of best performing DL models in the IoMT. This proposal will assist predictive analytics to advance CKD prediction by using deep learning more efficiently and effectively. The study is the first fundamental step toward a comprehensive performance assessment to classify and predict CKD using deep learning models and its associated risk factors.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease is a common term for multiple heterogeneous diseases in the kidneys. It is also known as Chronic Renal Disease. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a gradual loss of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) over three months. The patient does not observe any significant symptoms in the earlier stage of CKD, and it is not identifiable without clinical tests like urine and blood tests. Patients with CKD would have a higher chance of developing heart disease. CKD is a progressive and often irreversible process of renal function decline, which may reach an endpoint of end-stage renal failure, requiring renal replacement therapy. It is critical to diagnose progressive CKD at an early stage and predict patients prone to developing the disease further for timely therapeutic interventions. As such, researchers have expended enormous efforts in the development of novel biomarkers that may identify subjects with early CKD at risk of progression. In this study, we have developed an explainable machine learning model to predict chronic kidney disease by implementing an automated data pipeline using the Random Forest ensemble learning trees model and feature selection algorithm. The explainability of the proposed model has been assessed in terms of feature importance and explainability metrics. Three explainability methods; LIME, SHAP, and SKATER have been applied to interpret the developed model and to compare the explainability results using Interpretability, Fidelity, and Fidelity-to-Interpretability ratio as the explainability metrics.

AB  - The silent killer Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in wealthy countries and listed with the leading causes of death in impoverished countries. Because of its rising incidence, CKD is included in the most serious public health problems. It is apparent that early detection of CKD may reduce the severity of damage in maturity. The patient must go to a diagnostic facility and consult with a doctor. This significant issue has been solved with the introduction of machine learning. This study’s main objective is to build a model that can reliably predict a person’s risk of acquiring CKD. Data mining and machine learning techniques have been widely employed for forecasting chronic renal disease, but little research has been done mixing imputation approaches at the pre-processing stage and feature selection strategy so that classification accuracy will be enhanced. The CKD Database, which is used in the experiments and consists of 400 records with 25, is accessible through UCI’s machine learning repository. It does, however, have a large number of missing values, which is why we proposed combining several missing data imputation strategies to solve the problem. The chi-square test was used to select features in this work. A supervised machine learning classification model called Random Forest (RF) is utilized and optimized with gridsearch to diagnose CKD at an early stage. Following a cross-validation procedure with 5 folders, several metrics were utilized to evaluate the model. Our RF had a 99.24% accuracy. The model’s best result is created by considering the 10 best-selected features. When compared to previous studies, our results are among the best for assessment metrics and the ranking accuracy. However, with only fewer features. In practice, some decision assistance for renal illness’ diagnosis, prevention, and prediction are provided by this study.

AB  - The slow progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) makes early detection and effective treatment the only ways to prevent the mortality rates. In this study, an amalgamation of ensemble machine learning (ML) models has been leveraged in an effort to support clinicians in their goal of faster, more accurate CKD recognition and detection. By detecting and assessing the risk variables early on, patients could limit the ramifications of this disease on their health. Consequently, binary categorization is the basis of this proposed ML technique. The CKD dataset, obtained from the UCI machine learning repository was utilized in this research consisting of 400 instances and 24 attributes, which is comprised of indicators, symptoms, and risk factors. 80% of the data was used to train the model, while the remaining 20% was used for testing. While utilizing the entire set of 25 features, the CatBoost and Random Forest models outperformed and outmatched the remaining algorithms with an accuracy of 99%. The Decision Tree, Ada Boost, and SVM algorithms were then used, with a constructive accuracy rate of 98%, 98%, and 95%, respectively. Furthermore, ROC curve for the five chosen ML models was used as a significant evaluation metric to help improve and supplement our understanding of the performance of the CKD categorization challenges. The results showed that the CatBoost model is more efficient and competent in successfully and accurately classifying a patient's CKD status, with an accuracy of 99.9% when critical attributes were used.

AB  - A large portion of people suffer from Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in the world. Unfortunately, some of them don't know they have been contracted CKD until they need dialysis treatment at the end stage. Diagnosis through non-invasive ultrasonic imaging techniques become important clinical approaches for detecting CKD, and high potential or at-risk CKD patients could avoid being infected via blood test and/or reduce chances of abrupt deterioration in renal function by taking iodinated contrast medium. This research established a detection system based on computer vision and machine learning techniques for facilitating diagnosis of CKD and different stages of CKD. Novel features and support vector machine were applied for rapid detection. In this study, several evaluations on different clustered groups were performed and compared according to estimated glomerular filtration rates (GFR). In addition, the proposed system required 0.016 seconds in average for feature extraction and classification for each testing case. The results showed that the system could produce consistent diagnosis based on noninvasive ultrasonographic approaches and which could be considered as the most proper clinical diagnosis and medical treatment for CKD patients.

AB  - Chronic Kidney disease is a significant public health concern across the world, with rising incidence and prevalence, as well as negative effects such as renal failure, cardiovascular disease, and early mortality. A condition where the kidney reaches advanced state of loss of function. Unfortunately, there is no treatment for this condition; but, by detecting it early, it is possible to halt its growth and mitigate the harm. As a result, recognizing such sickness at an early stage is now a major concern. If risk factor for chronic kidney disease can be predicted at early stage it can be cured on time and appropriate action can be taken. To overcome this challenge Machine Learning plays an important role along with mining tools. This research study has proposed a novel feature selection method for selecting the prominent features to improve the performance of predictive model. As there is scope of improvement in performance with original instances so by selecting prominent features the performance of predictive is found to be quite satisfactory.

AB  - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD, also known as the Chronicrenal disease) is a communal problem to the public with an escalating in either technologically advanced or advancing countries. 10% of the populations internationally are diagnosed with the disease of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and many deaths each day because of poor access to proper treatment or absence of awareness. If necessary, precaution is not taken at the right time the treatment gets complicated and possibly reach the final stage. Thus, to provide a better dietary solution our paper proposes a model to basis of their potassium level in blood. Classification of the patients is implemented recommend food for patients suffering from kidney disease on the using WEKA and then further using query-based matching we recommended food for the identified levels based on the seriousness of the disease.
